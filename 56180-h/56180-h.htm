<p>This series of English History Source Books is intended
for use with any ordinary textbook of English History.
Experience has conclusively shown that such apparatus is
a valuable&mdash;nay, an indispensable&mdash;adjunct to the history
lesson. It is capable of two main uses: either by way of
lively illustration at the close of a lesson, or by way of inference-drawing,
before the textbook is read, at the beginning
of the lesson. The kind of problems and exercises that may
be based on the documents are legion, and are admirably
illustrated in a <i>History of England for Schools</i>, Part I., by
Keatinge and Frazer, pp. 377-381. However, we have no
wish to prescribe for the teacher the manner in which he shall
exercise his craft, but simply to provide him and his pupils
with materials hitherto not readily accessible for school
purposes. The very moderate price of the books in this
series should bring them within the reach of every secondary
school. Source books enable the pupil to take a more active
part than hitherto in the history lesson. Here is the apparatus,
the raw material: its use we leave to teacher and taught.</p>

<p>Our belief is that the books may profitably be used by all
grades of historical students between the standards of fourth-form
boys in secondary schools and undergraduates at Universities.
What differentiates students at one extreme from those
at the other is not so much the kind of subject-matter dealt
with, as the amount they can read into or extract from it.</p>

<p>In regard to choice of subject-matter, while trying to satisfy
the natural demand for certain "stock" documents of vital
importance, we hope to introduce much fresh and novel matter.
It is our intention that the majority of the extracts should be
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_vi" title="vi">vi</a>lively in style&mdash;that is, personal, or descriptive, or rhetorical,
or even strongly partisan&mdash;and should not so much profess to
give the truth as supply data for inference. We aim at the
greatest possible variety, and lay under contribution letters,
biographies, ballads and poems, diaries, debates, and newspaper
accounts. Economics, London, municipal, and social
life generally, and local history, are represented in these pages.</p>

<p>The order of the extracts is strictly chronological, each
being numbered, titled, and dated, and its authority given.
The text is modernised, where necessary, to the extent of
leaving no difficulties in reading.</p>

<p>We shall be most grateful to teachers and students who
may send us suggestions for improvements.</p>

<p>NOTE TO THIS VOLUME</p>

<p>I have to thank Sir E. Maunde Thompson and the Council
of the Royal Society of Literature for so readily permitting
me to quote from Sir E. Maunde Thompson's edition of Adam
of Usk's <i>Chronicle</i>. With three exceptions, the sources quoted
in this volume are contemporary, and, where I have employed
non-contemporary material, I have endeavoured to justify its
use in a prefatory note to the extract.</p>

</p>

<p><i>Postscript.</i>&mdash;Mr. C. L. Kingsford, in his valuable critical
account, <i>English Historical Literature in the Fifteenth Century</i>,
recently published, argues strongly against the accepted
authorship of the <i>Vita et gesta Henrici Quinti</i> (quoted on pp.
15-19). Hearne erroneously attributes it to Thomas Elmham.
Mr. Kingsford shows that the date of its composition lies
between 1446 and 1449, and that its anonymous author was,
in all probability, a foreigner.</p>

<p>On the eve of his coronation, in the Tower of London and
in the presence of Richard late King, King Henry made forty-six
new knights, amongst whom were his three sons, and also
the earls of Arundel and Stafford, and the son and heir of the
earl of Warwick; and with them and other nobles of the land
he passed in great state to Westminster. And when the day
of Coronation was come (13th October), all the peers of the
realm, robed finely in red and scarlet and ermine, came with
great joy to the ceremony, my lord of Canterbury ordering all
the service and duties thereof. In the presence were borne
four swords, whereof one was sheathed as a token of the
augmentation of military honour, two were wrapped in red and
bound round with golden bands to represent twofold mercy, and
the fourth was naked and without a point, the emblem of the
executioner of justice without rancour. The first sword the
earl of Northumberland carried, the two covered ones the earls
of Somerset and Warwick, and the sword of justice the King's
eldest son, the prince of Wales; and the lord Latimer bore the
sceptre, and the earl of Westmoreland the rod. And this they
did as well in the coronation as at the banquet, always standing
around the King. Before the King received the crown from
my lord of Canterbury, I heard him swear to take heed to rule
his people altogether in mercy and in truth. These were the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_2" title="2">2</a>officers in the Coronation feast: The earl of Arundel was
butler, the earl of Oxford held the ewer, and the lord Grey of
Ruthin spread the cloths.</p>

<p>While the King was in the midst of the banquet, sir Thomas
Dymock, knight, mounted in full armour on his destrier,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and
having his sword sheathed in black with a golden hilt, entered
the hall, two others, likewise mounted on chargers, bearing
before him a naked sword and a lance. And he caused proclamation
to be made by a herald at the four sides of the hall
that, if any man should say that his liege lord here present and
King of England was not of right crowned King of England,
he was ready to prove the contrary with his body, then and
there, or when and wheresoever it might please the King. And
the King said: "If need be, sir Thomas, I will in mine own
person ease thee of this office."</p>

<p>In the second year of this King the earls of Kent, Salisbury
and Huntingdon, unkind to the King, rose against him. Unkind
were they, for the people would have them dead and the
King spared them. These men, thus gathered, purposed to fall
on the King suddenly at Windsor, under the colour of mummeries
in Christmas time. The King was warned of this and
fled to London. These men knew not that, but came to
Windsor with four hundred armed men, purposing to kill the
King and his progeny, and restore Richard again unto the
crown. When they came to Windsor, and thus were deceived,
they fled to a town where the queen lay, fast by Reading, and
there, before the queen's household, he blessed him this earl of
Kent. "O benedicite," he said, "who may this be that Harry
of Lancaster hath taken the Tower at London, and our very
King Richard hath broken prison, and hath gathered a hundred
thousand fighting men." So gladded he the queen with lies,
and rode forth to Wallingford, and from Wallingford to Abing<a class="pagenum" name="Page_3" title="3">3</a>don,
warning all men by the way that they should make them
ready to help King Richard. Thus came he to Cirencester,
late at even. The men of the town had suspicion that their
tidings were lies, (as it was indeed,) rose and kept the entries
of the inns, that none of them might pass. There fought they
in the town from midnight unto nine of the clock in the
morrow. But the town drove them out of the Abbey and
smote off many of their heads. The earl of Salisbury was
dead there; and worthy, for he was a great favourite of the
Lollards, and a despiser of the sacraments, for he would not
confess when he should die.</p>

<p>The earl of Huntingdon heard of this and fled unto Essex.
And as often as he assayed to take the sea, so often was he
born off with the wind. Then was he taken by the Commons
and led to Chelmsford and then to Pleshy, and his head smote
off in the same place where he arrested the Duke of
Gloucester.</p>

<p>Item, Whereas it is shewed to our Sovereign Lord the King
on behalf of the Prelates and Clergy of his realm of England in
this present Parliament, That although the Catholic Faith
builded upon Christ and by his Apostles and the Holy Church
sufficiently determined, declared and approved, hath hitherto
by good and holy and most Noble Progenitors of our Sovereign
Lord the King... [been] most devoutly observed, and the
Church of England most laudably endowed and in her Rights
and Liberties sustained.... Yet divers false and perverse
People of a certain New Sect of the Faith ... do perversely
preach and teach these days, openly and privily, divers new
Doctrines, and wicked, heretical and erroneous Opinions contrary
to the same faith.... They make unlawful Conventicles
and Confederacies, they hold and exercise Schools, they
make and write Books, they do wickedly instruct and inform
People, and, as much as they may, incite and stir them to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_4" title="4">4</a>Sedition and Insurrection, and maketh great Strife and Division
among the people, and other Enormities horrible to be
heard daily do perpetrate and commit, in subversion of the
said Catholic Faith and Doctrine of the Holy Church.</p>

<p><i>Then follow clauses forbidding the Lollards to preach without
license, or to hold Schools for teaching the new doctrines, and a clause
punishing by fine and imprisonment all offenders who abjure their
heresy; finally</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>If any Person within the said Realm and Dominions, upon
the said wicked Preachings, Doctrines, Opinions, Schools and
heretical and erroneous Information ... be before the
Diocesan, and do refuse duly to abjure, or by the Diocesan of
the same place or his commission, after the abjuration made
by the same person, fall into relapse so that according to the
Holy Canons he ought to be left to the secular Court, whereupon
credence shall be given to the Diocesan of the same
place, or to his Commissionaries in this behalf; then the Sheriff
of the County of the same place, and Mayor and Sheriffs or
Sheriff, or Mayor and Bailiffs of the City, Town and Borough
of the same County shall be personally present in preferring of
such sentences; and they, the same persons and every one of
them, after such a sentence promulgate, shall receive them, and
before the People in an high place do them to be burnt; that
such punishment may strike in fear to the minds of others,
whereby no such wicked doctrines and heretical and erroneous
opinions ... against the Catholic Faith, Christian Law and
Determination of Holy Church, which God forbid, be sustained
or in any wise suffered.</p>

<p>In this autumn (1401), Owen Glendower, all North Wales
and Cardigan and Powis siding with him, sorely harried with
fire and sword the English who dwelt in those parts, and
their towns, and specially the town of Pool. Wherefore the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_5" title="5">5</a>English, invading those parts with a strong power, and utterly
laying them waste and ravaging them with fire, famine, and
sword, left them a desert, not even sparing children or churches,
nor the monastery of Strata-Florida, wherein the King himself
was being lodged, and the church of which and its choir, even
up to the high altar, they used as a stable, and pillaged even
the patens; and they carried away into England more than a
thousand children of both sexes to be their servants. Yet did
the same Owen do no small hurt to the English, slaying many
of them, and carrying off the arms, horses and tents of the
King's eldest son, the prince of Wales, and of other lords,
which he bare away for his own behoof to the mountain fastnesses
of Snowden.</p>

<p>In these days, southern Wales, and in particular all the
diocese of Llandaff, was at peace from every kind of trouble of
invasion or inroad.... The commons of Cardigan, being
pardoned their lives, deserted Owen, and returned, though in
sore wretchedness, to their homes, being allowed to use the
Welsh tongue, although its destruction had been determined
on by the English, Almighty God, the King of Kings, the
unerring Judge of all, having mercifully ordained the recall of
this decree at the prayer and cry of the oppressed....</p>

<p>... On the day of St. Alban (22nd June, 1402) near to
Knighton in Wales, was a hard battle fought between the
English under sir Edmund Mortimer and the Welsh under
Owen Glendower, with woeful slaughter even to eight thousand
souls, the victory being with Owen. And alas! my lord, the
said sir Edmund ... was by the fortune of war carried away
captive. And, being by his enemies in England stripped of all
his goods and hindered from paying ransom, in order to escape
more easily the pains of captivity, he is known by common report
to have wedded the daughter of the same Owen; by whom he
had a son Lionel, and three daughters, all of whom, except
one daughter, along with their mother are now dead. At last,
being by the English host beleagured in the castle of Harlech,
he brought his days of sorrow to an end, his wonderful deeds
being to this day told at the feast in song.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_6" title="6">6</a>
In this year also the lord Grey of Ruthin,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> being taken
captive by Owen, with the slaughter of two thousand of his
men, was shut up in prison; but he was set free on payment
of ransom of sixteen thousand pounds in gold. Concerning
such an ill-starred blow given by Owen to the English rule,
when I think thereon, my heart trembles. For, backed by a following
of thirty thousand men issuing from their lairs throughout
Wales and its marches, he overthrew castles, among which
were Usk, Caerleon, and Newport, and fired the towns. In
short, like a second Assyrian, the rod of God's anger, he did
deeds of unheard-of cruelty with fire and sword.</p>

<p>In the next year, on behalf of the crown of England claimed
for the earl of March, a deadly quarrel arose between the King
and the house of Percy of Northumberland, as kin to the same
earl, to the great agitation of the realm...; and a field
being pitched for the morrow of Saint Mary Magdalene
(23rd July), the King, by the advice of the earl of Dunbar of
Scotland, because the father of the lord Henry Percy and
Owen Glendower were then about to come against the King
with a great host, anticipating the appointed day, brought on
a most fearful battle against the said lord Henry and the lord
Thomas Percy, then earl of Worcester. And after that there
had fallen on either side in most bloody slaughter to the
number of sixteen thousand men, in the field of Berwick
(where the King afterwards founded a hospice for the souls of
those who there fell) two miles from Shrewsbury, on the eve
of the said feast, victory declared for the king who had thus
made the onslaught. In this battle the said lord Percy, the
flower and glory of Christendom, fell, alas! and with him his
uncle.... There fell also two noble knights in the King's
armour, each made conspicuous as though a second King,
having been placed for the King's safety in the rear line of
battle. Whereat the earl of Douglas of Scotland, then being in
the field with the said lord Henry, as his captive, when he heard
victory shouted for King Henry, cried in wonder: "Have I
not slain two King Henries (meaning the said knights) with
mine own hand? 'Tis an evil hour for us that a third yet
lives to be our victor."</p>

us through a woman, because there was no man who dared to

<p>Item our Lord the King, at the grievous complaints of his
Commons [in this present Parliament] of the undue election
of the Knights of Counties for the Parliament, which be some<a class="pagenum" name="Page_9" title="9">9</a>times
made of affection of the Sheriff, and otherwise against
the form of the writs directed to the Sheriff, to the great
slander of the Counties and the hindrance of the business of the
Commonalty of the said County; Our Sovereign Lord the
King, willing therein to provide a remedy, by the assent of the
Lords spiritual and temporal and the Commons in this present
Parliament assembled, hath ordained and established, that
from henceforth the elections of such knights shall be made in
the form that followeth: That is to say at the next County to
be holden after the delivery of the writ of the Parliament,
proclamation shall be made in the full County of the day and

then, in the full County, they shall proceed to the election
freely and indifferently, notwithstanding any request or command

<p>Be it remembered that on Monday the 21st day of November,
the King our sovereign lord being in the Council Chamber
in the Abbey of Gloucester, there being in his presence the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_10" title="10">10</a>lords spiritual and temporal at this present Parliament assembled,
there was a discussion among them concerning the state
of the realm and the defence of the same to resist the malice of
the enemies, who on every coast appeared to be harassing the
said realm and the faithful subjects of the same.... And
thereon it was demanded of the said lords, what aid would be
sufficient and necessary in this case. To which demand and
question the lords replied severally, that considering the
necessity of the King on the one part, and the poverty of his
people on the other part, a less aid could not suffice than to
have a tenth and a half from the cities and boroughs, and a
fifteenth and a half from other laymen. Further, to grant an
extension of the subsidy on wool, leather and woolfels, and
three shillings on the ton, and twelve pence in the pound, from
Michaelmas next until Michaelmas in two years next ensuing.
Thereon, by command of the King our said lord, it was conveyed
to the Commons of this present Parliament that they
should send to our said lord the King and the said lords a
certain number of persons of their company to hear and to report
to their colleagues what they should have as a command of
our said lord the King. And thereupon the said Commons
sent to the presence of the King our said lord, and the said
lords, twelve of their number: to whom, by command of our
said lord the King, was declared the question above-mentioned
and the reply of the aforesaid lords to it. This reply it was
the will of our said lord the King that they should convey to
the rest of their colleagues [in the Commons]; finally that
they (of the Commons) should conform as near as possible to
the purpose of the aforesaid lords. This report thus conveyed
to the said Commons, they were greatly perturbed by it, saying
and affirming this to be in great prejudice and derogation of
their liberties; and when our said lord the King heard this,
not wishing that anything should be done at present nor in the
future, which could turn in any wise against the liberty of the
estate for which they were come to Parliament, nor against
the liberties of the lords aforesaid, willed and granted and
declared, with the advice of the said lords, in the following
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_11" title="11">11</a>manner: That is to say, that it is lawful for the lords to
debate among themselves in this present Parliament, and in
every other [Parliament] in time to come, in the absence of
the King, touching the state of the realm and the remedy
necessary for it. And that, in like manner, it is lawful for the
Commons, on their part, to debate together touching the state
and remedy aforesaid. Provided always that the lords on their
part and the Commons on theirs, make no report to our said
lord the King of any grant granted by the Commons and
assented to by the lords, nor of the communications concerning
the said grant, before the said lords and Commons shall
be of one assent and of one accord in this matter, and then in
the manner and form that is customary, that is to say by the
mouth of the Speaker of the said Commons for the time being,
so that the said lords and Commons should have the agreement
of our said lord the King. Also our said lord the King
wills, also with the assent of the aforesaid lords, that the communications
held in this present Parliament as aforesaid shall
not be treated as an example for the future, nor be turned to
the prejudice or derogation of the liberty of the estate for
which the Commons are now come together, neither in the
present Parliament nor in any other in the future. But he
[the King] wills that the said, and all the other estates, be as
free as they had been before.</p>

he was brought into Smithfield for to be burnt, and bound
unto a stake; and Sir Harry Prince of Wales counselled him
to hold the very right belief of Holy Church, and he should
fail neither lack no good. Also the Chancellor of Oxford, one
Master Courteney, informed him in the faith of Holy Church,
and the Prior of Saint Bartholomew brought the Holy Sacra<a class="pagenum" name="Page_12" title="12">12</a>ment

was asked him how that he believed. And he answered
and said that he wist well that it was holy bread, and not
God's own blessed body. And then was the tonne put over
him and fire put unto him; and when he felt the fire he cried
mercy. And anon the prince commanded to take away the fire,
and it was done so anon. And then the prince asked him if
that he would forsake his heresy and believe on the faith of all
Holy Church, and he would give him his life and goods
enough while he lived; but he would not, but continued forth
in his heresy. And then the prince commanded him up to be
burnt at once, and so he was. And John Gylott, vynter, he
made two weavers to be taken, the which followed the same
way of heresy.</p>

<p>In this year and 20th day of November, was a great
council holden at the White Friars in London, by the which
it was among other things concluded, that, for the King's
great journey that he intended to make in visiting of the holy
sepulchre of our Lord, certain galleys of war should be made,
and other purveyance concerning the same journey. Whereupon
all hasty and possible speed was made; but after the
feast of Christmas, while he was making his prayers at Saint
Edward's shrine, to take there his leave, and so speed him
upon his journey, he became so sick that such as were about
him feared that he would have died right there, wherefore they
for his comfort bore him into the Abbot's place and lodged him
in a chamber, and there upon a pallet laid him before the fire,
where he lay in great agony a certain of time. At length when
he was come to himself, not knowing where he was, he
enquired, of such as there were about him, what place that was;
the which showed to him that it belonged to the Abbot of
Westminster, and for he felt himself so sick, he commanded to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_13" title="13">13</a>ask if that chamber had any special name, whereunto it was
answered that it was named Jerusalem. Then said the King:
"Loving be to the Father of Heaven, for now I know that
I shall die in this chamber, according to the prophecy of me
before said, that I should die at Jerusalem"; and so after he
made himself ready and died shortly after.</p>

<p>And his lords gave him [Henry V.] counsel, to send ambassadors
unto the King of France and his council, and that he
should give up to him his right heritage, that is to say
Normandy, Gascony, and Guienne, the which his predecessors
had held before him, or else he would it win with dint of sword,
in short time, with the help of Almighty God. And then the
Dauphin of France answered our ambassadors, and said in this
manner, that the King was over young and too tender of age
to make war against him, and was not like yet to be no good
warrior to do and to make such a conquest there upon him;
and somewhat in scorn and despite he sent to him a tonne full
of tennis balls because he would have somewhat for to play
withal for him and for his lords, and that became him better
than to maintain any war; and then anon our lords that was

... and thought to avenge him upon them as soon as God
would send him grace and might, and anon made tennis balls
for the Dauphin, in all haste; and they were great gun-stones
for the Dauphin to play withal.</p>

righteousness, That so it hath ever been their liberty and freedom
that there should no statute nor law be made unless they
give thereto their assent: Considering that the Commune of

mischief asking remedy by the mouth of their Speaker or else

or as many as them lust: But that ever it stand in the freedom

no thing be enacted to the petitions of his Commune

<p>A.&mdash;<i>The Disposition and Order of the English Army.</i></p>

<p>The night being spent but Titan not yet risen above the
horizon, scarce had Friday dawned (on which the day the
martyrdom of the blessed Crispin and Crispinian is celebrated)
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" title="16">16</a>than the King neglected not to lead out his troops into the
field, having first said matins and heard mass, and thinking
that his enemies would be more engaged in fighting than in
plundering, he ordered the horses of his men and whatever
other things his army had brought with them except their
arms, to be left in the village in which they had been quartered
in the night, and assigned to the care of a few soldiers....
But in order that his army, which was very small in comparison
to the French, might be able to fight without a wide
separation, he arrayed it for battle in this wise: to the middle
battalion, which he himself led, and in which under the mercy
of God he proposed to fight, he assigned and chose a likely
place about the middle of the field, so that it might meet the
middle battalion of the enemy. On his right, at scarcely any
distance, he placed the vanguard of his army and joined it to
the wing at his right hand. But on the King's left was the
rearward of the army, to which the left wing was likewise
joined. These being so placed the providence of the divine
grace was manifestly displayed, which provided for so small an
army so apt a field enclosed within hedges and bushes ... to
protect them from being surrounded by the ambuscades of the
enemy. Now the King was clad in strong and very glittering
armour; on his head he bore a helmet with a large resplendent
crest and a crown of gold glistening with precious stones; his
body begirt with a surcoat with the arms of England and
France, from which heavenly splendour there sprang forth, on
the one side, three golden flowers in a field of azure, on the
other side three golden leopards sporting in a ruby field....
[He], seated on a noble horse of snowy whiteness, having also
horses following bedecked in kingly fashion with the richest
trappings, wondrously incited his army to deeds of valour.
The nobles also, by the King's side, were arrayed with coats of
arms as became those about to engage in conflict. And when
the King heard someone wishing that whatever nobles of the
realm of England, who were well-disposed thereto, were
present at this affair, with kingly steadfastness he thus replied,
"Truly I would not that by one single person the number of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_17" title="17">17</a>this army should be increased. For if in the number of fighting
men, we were equal to, or perhaps, stronger than, our
enemies, and they were delivered into our hands by the
hazards of war, our indiscreet judgement would attribute the
victory to the greatness of our strength, and so due praise
would by no means be accorded. But if, after God's own
manifold chastisement for our sins, the divine judgement should
determine to deliver us into the hands of the enemy,...
certainly then our army would be too great to be exposed
(which God forbid!) to so great a calamity. But if the divine
mercy should deign to deliver so many adversaries to so trifling
a force of fighting men, we should deem so great a victory
certainly bestowed by God upon us and return thanks to
Him and not to our own numbers. Lo! he who is splendidly
and safely defended and armed in body is fortified in mind
much more gloriously by stern hope and unbroken fortitude."</p>


<p>B.&mdash;<i>The Disposition and Order of the French Army.</i></p>

<p>The enemy, despising the idleness and inaction of the King's
army, endeavoured to prepare their numerous formations
in proper order for battle.... They drew up their army
after their own fashion, as the King had drawn up his; nevertheless
the breadth of the field was not sufficient to draw up so
numerous a host into proper battle array. For whereas the
English army, throughout all its lines, was scarcely strengthened
with files of four men, one behind another crosswise,
all the French lines throughout their length were strengthened
with files of twenty or more fighting men, one behind the
other. Also, in the outermost flank of their army were placed
a thousand soldiers, to break through the English lines with
cavalry charges; also certain <i>saxi-voma</i>,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> which might scatter
the English when about to engage in battle, or at least throw
them into disorder, were drawn up along the flanks of the
army. But the number of standards and other warlike ensigns,
which were displayed by the French army, fastened on the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" title="18">18</a>points of lances and rustling in the wind, seemed to exceed the
multitude of lances in the English army....</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Engines for hurling stones.</p></div>


<p>C.&mdash;<i>The Battle.</i></p>

<p>Thus drawn up across the fields on both sides and three bow
shots, or thereabouts, distant from each other, each army awaited
the movements of the other, but neither advanced against the
other for some time. Yet the French cavalry, advancing a little
into the field, were by the King's command forced to retreat
hastily, through certain of the royal archers, on to their army.
Also certain French barons, by their own wishes, came into the
King's presence, and without being able to find out anything
the King proposed to do, were soon ordered to return to their
own army. Now King Henry, when he considered that a
great part of the short day was already passed, and readily believing
that the French were not disposed to move from their
position, consulted the nobles and experts as to what they
should do, viz., whether he should advance with his army, in
the order in which it stood, against the enemy who refused to
move against him. They, having fully considered the circumstances
of so important a matter, decided that the King should
advance with his army towards the enemy, and mightily charge
them in the name of God.... Without delay both men-at-arms,
unheeding their heavy arms, and the archers, leaving
behind in the field their sharp stakes which they had
previously prepared to meet the French cavalry, all having
bowed the knee and taken lumps of earth in their mouths,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
with a warlike shout piercing the heavens and with wonderful
dash, flew fiercely along the plain, and their outward bearing
shewed how much courage fired their hearts. And when they
had approached within twenty paces of the ranks of the enemy,
not far from Agincourt, and the sounds of the trumpets rending
the air had stirred the spirits of the warriors to battle, the
enemy, now for the first time moving, advanced to meet the
English. Immediately the battle commenced with such fury
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" title="19">19</a>that at the first attack of such brave warriors, by the dire
shock of lances and the violent blows of swords the joints of
their strong armour were broken, and the first rank on both
sides dealt deadly wounds. But, on the other side, the warlike
band of archers, with their strong and numerous volleys,
darkened the air, shedding, like a cloud laden with rain, an unbearable
multitude of piercing arrows, and, inflicting wounds
on the horses, either threw to the ground the French cavalry
who were drawn up to charge them, or forced them to retreat....
In this deadly conflict be it remembered among other
things that that bright shining Titan of Kings so much exposed
the precious treasure of his person to every chance of war that
he thundered upon his enemies swift terrors and intolerable
attacks.... After a while all the King's battalions, foremost
and hindmost, were victorious, each wing having overthrown
the enemy.... And, by divine mercy, having gained so
glorious a triumph, the magnanimous King ... was gratefully
minded to return thanks most devoutly for so great a victory.
And, because so great a victory was vouchsafed to him on the
feast of St. Crispin and Crispinian, every day throughout his
life he heard mention of them in one of his masses.</p>

<p class="subheading"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;"Customs of Hereford," in the <i>Journal of the British
Arch&aelig;ological Association</i>, vol. xxvii., pp. 460 <i>et seq.</i> (London:
1871.)</p>

<p>[The customs of Hereford were placed on record in the reign of Henry V.,
and rewritten in 1486. Many of the customs were of much older date; even
in 1486 some were of a duration from "time immemorial."]</p>


<p><i>Election of Bailiff.</i>&mdash;First of all we use at the Feast of St.
Michael to choose unto us a bailiff of our fellow-citizens, by
the whole consent of the city, who is powerful to labour and
discreet to judge, holding some tenements or hereditaments in
the fee of our Lord the King; and he to be our head next
under the King, whom we ought, in all things touching our
King or the state of our city, to obey chiefly in three things,&mdash;first,
when we are sent for, by day or by night, to consult of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" title="20">20</a>those things which appertain to the King or the state of
the city; secondly, to answer if we offend in any point contrary
to our oath, or to our fellow-citizens; thirdly, to perform
the affairs of our city at our own charges, if so be they may be
finished sooner or better than by any other of our citizens....
And this shall be the oath of the bailiff when he is chosen.
He shall not have respect to anyone's person who hath been
heretofore elected.</p>

<p><i>The Mayor's Oath.</i>&mdash;First, that he shall be true to our Lord
the King in all things; secondly, that as much as in him lies,
as well by day as by night, he shall faithfully defend and keep
the city of Hereford, the city of our Lord the King; thirdly,
he shall defend and maintain the laws and customs of the city
during his time;... fourthly, that he shall administer justice
and judgement to every one, not having respect to any one's
person; fifthly, that he shall not hold or keep the office of his
mayoralty but for one year after his election; sixthly, if so be
that he be a layman, he shall do all things belonging to his
office by the counsel of his faithful citizens....</p>

<p><i>Concerning our courts</i>, we use to keep them on a Tuesday,
from the fifteenth day until fifteen days; unto which courts
all citizens of our Lord the King ought to come, and chiefly all
those which hold any tenement of our Lord the King; and
especially to the two first courts holden after the feasts of
Michaelmas and Easter, at which two courts the assize of
bread and beer shall be ordained, and keepers to keep the
same assize; and unto the said courts and other courts [shall
come] all others who complain of any trespasses committed, or
any other thing touching the state of the city or themselves,
and they ought to speak the truth upon their own peril, not
bringing with them any stranger ... because we do not use
that strangers shall come and implead amongst us, and know
the secrets of the courts, for divers dangers that thereby may
ensue....</p>

<p><i>Night-Walkers.</i>&mdash;And it shall be commanded ... that,
among other things, it shall be proclaimed that no vagabond
or night-walker be within our city, nor in the suburbs, after
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" title="21">21</a>the ringing of our common bell; and if anyone be taken after
the ringing of the bell, let him be brought unto the gaol of our
Lord the King, and there he shall stay until the morrow....
Concerning our bell, we use to have it in a public place, where
our chief bailiff may come, as well by day as by night, to give
warning to all men living within the said city and suburbs.
And we do not say that it ought to ring unless it be for some
terrible fire burning any row of houses within the said city, or
for any common contention whereby the city might be terribly
moved, or for any enemies drawing near unto the city, or if
the city be besieged, or any sedition shall be between any, and
notice thereof given by any unto our chief bailiff.... Also
we use that if any one of our citizens hath any tenements
situate in the High Street of the city, or having over part of
the pavement, and it be ruinous, so that danger may happen
to us or to our children, or to others going along the city; and
especially if the Lord our King, or any of his, should happen
to pass along that street ... in such case our chief bailiff
shall cause them to be warned that have such tenements, that
they amend them in more safer manner within three days; and
unless they do so, let three days more be given them, in the
behalf of our Lord the King and the commonalty; and unless
it be then done, our chief bailiff, taking with him the power of
the city, if it be needful, shall go to such a tenement, and in
his presence let it be thrown down at the costs of him to whom
the tenement belongeth, or if needful, at the costs of the
commonalty;...</p>

<p><i>Brewers to the Cucking-Stools.</i>&mdash;... And if any brewer hath
brewed and broken the assize of our Lord the King, allowed
and publicly proclaimed in the said city, she ought by the
bailiff to be amerced the first and the second time; and if she
break the assize the third time, she ought to be taken by the
bailiff and to be led to the judgement which is called the
Gongestole....</p>

<p><i>Scolds.</i>&mdash;Also it was agreed upon concerning scolding women,
that by them many evils do arise in the city viz. by wrangling,
fighting, defaming, troubling by night those which are at rest,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" title="22">22</a>and often times moving schisms between their neighbours, and
by contradicting the bailiff and ministers and others; and in
their prison, by speaking ill or cursing them,... wherefore,
at all times when they shall be taken and convicted, they shall
have their judgement, without any redemption to be made;
and there they shall stand, with their feet bare, and their hair
hanging about their ears, by so much time as they may be
seen of all those which pass by that way ... and afterwards,
the judgement being finished, let her (the scold) be brought to
the gaol of our Lord the King, and there stay until she hath
made redemption at the will of the bailiff. And if she
will not be amended by such punishment, let her be cast out
of the city.</p>

<p>And upon the day appointed he was brought out of the
Tower with his arms bound behind him, having a very cheerful
countenance. Then was he laid upon an hurdle, as though
he had been a most heinous traitor to the Crown, and so
drawn forth into Saint Giles Field, where they had set up a
new pair of gallows. As he was come to the place of execution,
and was taken from the hurdle, he fell down devoutly on
his knees, desiring Almighty God to forgive his enemies.
Then stood he up and beheld the multitude, exhorting them, in
most goodly manner, to follow the laws of God written in the
Scriptures and in any wise to beware of such teachers as they
see contrary to Christ in their conversation and living; with
many other special counsels. Then was he hanged up there
by the middle in chains of iron, and so consumed alive in the
fire; praising the name of God so long as his life lasted. In
the end he commended his soul into the hands of God, and
so departed hence most christianly, his body resolved into
ashes.</p>

<p>Henry by the grace of God, King of England, Heir and

<p>First, it is accorded between our aforesaid father and us

father is holden with divers sickness, in such manner as he

<p>King Henry, finding himself mortally ill, called to him
his brother the Duke of Bedford, his uncle of Exeter, the earl
of Warwick, sir Louis de Robesart and others, to the number
of six or eight of those in whom he had the greatest confidence,
and said that he saw with grief it was the pleasure of his
Creator that he should quit this world. He then addressed
the Duke of Bedford:&mdash;"John, my good brother, I beseech
you, on the loyalty and love you have ever expressed for me,
that you show the same loyalty and affection to my son Henry,
your nephew, and that, so long as you shall live, you do not
suffer him to conclude any treaty with our adversary Charles,
and that on no account whatever the duchy of Normandy be
wholly restored to him. Should our good brother of Burgundy
be desirous of the regency of the Kingdom of France, I would
advise that you let him have it; but should he refuse, then
take it yourself. My good uncle of Exeter, I nominate you
sole regent of the Kingdom of England, for that you well
know how to govern it; and I entreat that you do not, on any
pretence whatever, return to France; and I likewise nominate
you as guardian to my son,&mdash;and I insist, on your love to me,
that you do very often personally visit and see him. My dear
cousin of Warwick, I will that you be his governor, and that
you teach him all things becoming his rank, for I cannot provide
a fitter person for the purpose. I entreat you all as earnestly
as I can, that you avoid all quarrels and dissensions with our
fair brother of Burgundy; and this I particularly recommend
to the consideration of my fair brother Humphrey,&mdash;for should
any coolness subsist between you, which God forbid, the affairs
of this realm, which are now in a very promising state, would
soon be ruined." ... The King then sent for his physicians,
and earnestly demanded of them how long they thought he
had to live. They delayed answering the question directly;
but, not to discourage hope, they said that it depended solely
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_27" title="27">27</a>on the will of God whether he would be restored to health.
He was dissatisfied with this answer, and repeated his request,
begging of them to tell him the truth. Upon this they consulted
together, and one of them, as spokesman, falling on his
knees, said, "Sire, you must think on your soul; for, unless it
be the will of God to decree otherwise, it is impossible that
you should live more than two hours." The King, hearing
this, sent for his confessor, some of his household and his
chaplains, whom he ordered to chant the seven penitential
psalms. When they came to "<i>Benigne fac Domine</i>" where mention
is made "<i>Muri Hierusalem</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> he stopped them, and said
aloud, that he had fully intended, after he had wholly subdued
the realm of France to his obedience, and restored it to peace,
to have gone to conquer the Kingdom of Jerusalem, if it had
pleased his Creator to have granted him a longer life. Having
said this, he allowed the priests to proceed, and shortly after,
according to the prediction of his physicians, gave up the
ghost.</p>

<p class="subheading"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Waurin's <i>Chronicles</i>, 1422-1431, pp. 73-78. (Rolls Series.)</p>


<p>The Duke of Bedford, the regent, took the field in very
fair array, and rode on until he had passed the woods near
Verneuil; and when he found himself in the plain he beheld
the town and all the force of the French arranged and set in
order of battle, which was a very fair thing to see; for without
doubt I, the author of this work, had never seen a fairer company,
nor one where there were so many of the nobility as
there were there, nor set in better order, nor showing greater
appearance of a desire to fight; I saw the assembly at
Azincourt, where there were many more princes and troops,
and also that at Crevant, which was a very fine affair, but
certainly that at Verneuil was of all the most formidable and
the best fought.... At the onset there was a great noise
and great shouting with tumultuous sounds of the trumpets
and clarions; the one side cried "Saint Denis!" and the
others "Saint George!" And so horrible was the shouting
that there was no man so brave or confident that he was not
in fear of death; they began to strike with axes and to thrust
with lances, then they put their hands to their swords, with
which they gave each other great blows and deadly strokes;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" title="29">29</a>the archers of England and the Scots, who were with the
French, began to shoot one against the other so murderously
that it was a horror to look upon them, for they carried death
to those whom they struck with full force. After the shooting,
the opponents attacked each other very furiously, hand to
hand; and this battle was on a Thursday, the seventeenth
day of August, commencing about two hours after noon....
Many a capture and many a rescue was made there, and many
a drop of blood shed, which was a great horror and irreparable
pity to see Christian people so destroy one another, for during
this pitiable and deadly battle mercy had no place there, so
much did the parties hate each other; the blood of the slain
stretched upon the ground, and that of the wounded ran in
great streams about the field. This battle lasted about three-quarters
of an hour, very terrible and sanguinary, and it was
not then in the memory of man to have seen two parties so
mighty for such a space of time in like manner fight without
being able to perceive to whom the loss or victory would
turn.... Elsewhere, the duke of Bedford, as I hear related,
for I could not see or comprehend the whole since I was
sufficiently occupied in defending myself, did that day wonderful
feats of arms, and killed many a man, for with an axe
which he held in his two hands he reached no one whom he
did not punish, since he was large in body and stout in limb,
wise and brave in arms; but he was very greatly harassed by
the Scots, especially by the earl of Douglas and his troop,
insomuch that one knew not what to think nor to imagine
how the affair would terminate, for the French, who had
more men by one-half than the English, fought only to
conquer....</p>

<p>Then the French began to be dismayed, losing altogether
the hope of victory which a little while before they thought
was in their hands, but each one of them sought a place
where he could save himself, taking flight as best he might,
and abandoning the rest; some drew towards the town and
others took the fields....</p>

<p>Finally, the English pursued the French so, that they
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_30" title="30">30</a>obtained the complete victory on that day and gained the
battle, but not without great effusion of their own blood.</p>

<p>The regent duke of Bedford, while at Paris, had collected
about five hundred carts and cars from the borders of Normandy
and from the Isle of France, which different merchants
were ordered to load with provisions, stores and other things,
and to have conveyed to the English army before Orleans....
This armament left Paris on Ash Wednesday, under the command
of Sir John Falstaff, who conducted the convoy with his
forces in good order, by short marches, until he came near the
village of Rouvroi in Beauce, situated between Genville and
Orleans. Many French captains, having long before heard of
his coming, were there assembled to wait his arrival, namely
Charles duke of Bourbon, the two marshals of France, the
constable of Scotland and his son ... and others of the nobility,
having with them from three to four thousand men. The
English had been informed of this force being assembled from
different garrisons which they had in those parts, and lost no
time in forming a square with their carts and carriages, leaving
but two openings, in which square they enclosed themselves,
posting their archers as guards to these entrances, and the
men-at-arms hard by to support them. On the strongest side
of this enclosure were the merchants, pages, carters, and those
incapable of defending themselves, with their horses. The
English, thus situated, waited two hours for the coming of the
enemy, who at length arrived with much noise, and drew up
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_32" title="32">32</a>out of bowshot in front of the enclosure. It seemed to them
that, considering their superior numbers, the state of the convoy,
and that there were not more than six hundred real
Englishmen, the rest being composed of all nations, they could
not escape falling into their hands, and must be speedily conquered.
Others, however, had their fears of the contrary
happening, for the French captains did not well agree together
as to their mode of fighting, for the Scots would combat on
foot, and the others on horseback.... In the meantime the
constable of Scotland, his son and all their men, dismounted
and advanced to attack their adversaries, by whom they were
received with great courage. The English archers, under the
shelter of their carriages, shot so well and stiffly that all on
horseback within their reach were glad to retreat with their
men-at-arms. The constable of Scotland and his men attacked
one of the entrances of the enclosure, but they were soon slain
on the spot.... The other French captains retreated with
their men to the places whence they had come. The English,
on their departure, refreshed themselves and then marched
away in haste for their town of Rouvroi, where they halted
for the night. On the morrow they departed in handsome
array with their convoy and artillery, and in a few days
arrived before Orleans, very much rejoiced at their good
fortune in the late attack from the French, and at having so
successfully brought provision to their countrymen.</p>

<p>This battle was ever afterward called the Battle of Herrings,
because great part of the convoy consisted of herrings and
other articles of food suitable to Lent.</p>

<p>... The troops in Orleans then seeing that they were very
strongly pressed by the diligence of the besiegers, both by
their engines and by the towers which they had made around
the town, to the number of twenty-two, and that by the con<a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" title="33">33</a>tinuance
thereof they were in danger of being placed in servitude
and obedience to their enemies the English, prepared
themselves for all risks and decided to resist with all their
power and in all the ways that they well could, so that, the
better to help, they sent to King Charles to obtain aid in men
and provisions; and there were then sent to them from four to
five hundred combatants, and soon after fully seven thousand
were sent to them, and some boats loaded with provisions
coming down the river under the guidance and protection of
these men-at-arms, in which company was the maid Joan, who
had not yet done anything for which she was held in much
esteem.</p>

<p>Then the English captains holding the siege, knowing of
the coming of the said boats and of those who convoyed them,
at once and in haste endeavoured to resist by force in order to
prevent them from landing in the town of Orleans, and on the
other hand the French exerted themselves to bring them in by
force of arms. On the vessels coming up to pass there was
many a lance broken, many an arrow shot, and many a bolt
shot by the engines, and so great a noise was made both by
the besieged and by the besiegers, both by defenders and
assailants, that it was horrible to hear them; but whatever
force or resistance the English could make there, the French
in spite of them brought their boats in safety into the town, at
which the said English were much troubled and the French
joyful at their good fortune, so they also entered the said town,
where they were welcomed as well for the provisions they had
brought as for the maid whom they had taken back with them,
great rejoicings being made everywhere for the good succour
King Charles sent them, whence they plainly perceived the
good will that he had towards them, at which the inhabitants
of the city rejoiced greatly, making such a clamour that they
were heard quite plainly by the besiegers.</p>

<p>Then when the next day came, which was Thursday, when
every one was refreshed, the maid Joan, rising early in the
morning, spoke in council to some captains and chiefs of
squadrons, to whom she showed by forcible arguments how
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_34" title="34">34</a>they had come there on purpose to defend that city against
the ancient enemies of the kingdom of France, who were
greatly oppressing it, and to such a degree that she saw that
it was in great danger if good provision were not speedily made
for it; so she admonished them to go and arm themselves, and
effected so much by her words that she induced them to do so,
and said to them that if they would follow her she doubted
not that she would cause such damage that it would ever be
remembered, and that the enemy would curse the hour of her
coming.</p>

<p>The maid preached so well to them that they all went to arm
themselves with her; then they sallied out of the town in very
fair array, and setting out she said to the captains: "Lords,
take courage and good hope; before four days have passed
your enemies will be vanquished." And the captains and
men-of-war who were there could not wonder sufficiently at
her words.</p>

<p>So they marched forward and came very fiercely to attack
one of the towers of their enemies that was called the tower of
Saint Leu, which was very strong, and therein were from three
to four hundred combatants, who in a very short time were
overcome, captured, or slain, and the tower burnt and demolished;
then, this done, the maid and her people returned
joyfully into the city of Orleans where she was generally
honoured and praised by all kinds of people. Again the next
day, which was Friday she and her men sallied from the town,
and she went to attack the second tower which was also taken
by a fine assault, and those within all slain or captured; and
after she had caused the said tower to be broken down, set on
fire, and entirely annihilated, she withdrew into the town,
where she was honoured and exalted more than before by all
the inhabitants thereof. The Saturday following, the maid
sallied forth again and went to attack the tower at the end of
the bridge, which was marvellously large and strong, and
besides occupied by a great number of the best and most tried
combatants among the besiegers, who long and valiantly
defended themselves, but it availed them nothing, for at last,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" title="35">35</a>like the others, they were discomfited, taken, and slain; among
whom died there the lord of Molines, Glacedale, a very valiant
esquire, the bailly of Evreux and many other noble men of
high rank.</p>

<p>After this brilliant conquest the French returned joyfully
into the town.</p>

<p>... "It is a sufficiently common report already spread
abroad, as it were everywhere, how this woman who caused
herself to be called Joan the maid, a false soothsayer, for two
years or more, against the divine law and the condition of her
female sex, has clothed and conducted herself in the dress and
manner of man, a thing displeasing and abominable to God,
and in such condition was carried before our capital enemy
and yours, to whom and to those of his party she often gave it
out, and even to churchmen, nobles, and people, that she was
sent by God, presumptuously boasting herself that she often
had personal and visible communication with Saint Michael
and a great multitude of other angels and saints of Paradise,
with Saint Katherine and Saint Margaret; by which false
givings-out, and by the hope of future victories which she
promised, she turned away the hearts of many men and
women from the truth, and turned them towards fables and
lies: she also clothed herself with armour suitable for knights
and esquires, raised a standard, and with too great excess,
pride, and presumption demanded to have the very excellent
arms of France, which in part she obtained, and bore them
in many expeditions and assaults, that is to say, a shield with
two fleurs-de-lis of gold on a field azure, and a sword with the
point fixed upwards in a crown; and in this condition she has
taken the field, with the leadership of men at arms and archers,
in armies and great companies, to do and perpetrate inhuman
cruelties, wickedly shedding human blood, and causing also
commotions and seditions of the people, inciting them to perjuries,
rebellions, superstitions, and false beliefs, perturbing all
good peace and renewing mortal war, suffering herself to be
revered and adored by many persons as a sanctified soul, and
otherwise acting damnably in many other matters too long to
express, which nevertheless have been well enough known in
many places, whereby nearly all Christendom has been greatly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_37" title="37">37</a>scandalized. But the Divine Power having pity on His loyal
people, whom He has not long left in peril, nor suffered them
to remain in the vain, perilous, and novel cruelties into which
they had thoughtlessly thrown themselves, has been pleased
to permit it in His great mercy and clemency that the said
shameful woman has been taken in your army and siege
which you were then maintaining on our behalf before Compi&egrave;gne,
and put by your good help into our obedience and
governance. And because we were afterwards requested by
the bishop in whose diocese she had been taken that this Joan,
branded and charged with crimes of high treason against God,
we would cause to be delivered to him as to her ordinary
ecclesiastical judge, as well for reverence of our mother holy
church, whose sacred ordinances we desire to prefer to our own
deeds and wishes as is right, as also for the honour and exaltation
of our true faith, we caused the said Joan to be given up
in order that he might try her, without wishing that any vengeance
or punishment should be inflicted upon her by our
secular officers of justice, as it was reasonably lawful for us to
do, considering the great damages and inconveniences, the
horrible homicides and detestable cruelties and evils, as it
were innumerable, that she had committed against our seignory
and our loyal and obedient people. This bishop, the inquisitor
of errors and heresies being associated with him, and a
great and notable number of famous masters and doctors of
theology and canon law being summoned with them, commenced
with great solemnity and due gravity the trial of this
Joan, and after he and the said inquisitor, judges in this behalf,
had on many different days questioned the said Joan, they
caused her confessions and assertions to be maturely examined
by the masters and doctors, and generally by all the faculties
of learning of our very dear and much loved daughter the
University of Paris, before which the said assertions and confessions
were sent, according to whose opinion and deliberation
the said judges found this Joan superstitious, a soothsayer by
means of devils, a blasphemer of God and of the saints, a
schismatic, and erring many times from the law of Jesus
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_38" title="38">38</a>Christ. And to bring her back into the union and communion
of our holy mother the church, to cleanse her from such
horrible and pernicious crimes and sins, and to keep and preserve
her soul from perpetual torment and damnation, she was
often, during a long time, very lovingly and gently admonished
that all her errors being rejected by her should be put away,
and that she should humbly return into the way and straight
path of truth, or otherwise she would put herself in great peril
of soul and body; but the very perilous and mad spirit of
pride and outrageous presumption, which is always exerting
itself to try to impede and disturb the path and way of loyal
Christians, so seized upon and detained in its bonds this Joan
and her heart, that for no holy doctrine, good counsels or
exhortation that could be administered to her, would her
hardened and obstinate heart humble or soften itself, but she
often again boasted that all things that she had done were well
done, and she had done them at the commandment of God
through the angels and the said holy virgins who visibly
appeared to her: and what is worse, she recognized not, nor
would recognize, any upon earth save God only and the saints
of Paradise, rejecting the authority of our holy father the pope,
the general council and the universal church militant. And
then the ecclesiastical judges, seeing her said disposition pertinaciously,
and for so long a space, remain hardened and
obstinate, caused her to be brought before the clergy and
people there assembled in very great multitude, in whose
presence her case, crimes, and errors were preached, made
known, and declared by a notable master and doctor of theology,
for the exaltation of our faith, the extirpation of errors,
the edification and amendment of Christian people. And
there, again, she was lovingly admonished to return to the
union of holy church, correcting her faults and errors, in
which she still remained pertinacious and obstinate. This the
judges aforesaid seeing and considering, they proceeded further
and pronounced against her the sentence in such case by law
prescribed and ordained; but before the said sentence was
read through she began seemingly to change her disposition,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_39" title="39">39</a>saying that she wished to return to holy church, which willingly
and joyfully heard the aforesaid judges and clergy, who
thereto received her affectionately, hoping that her soul and
body were redeemed from perdition and torment. Then she
submitted herself entirely to the ordinance of the Church, and
orally revoked and publicly abjured her errors and detestable
crimes, signing with her own hand the schedule of the said
revocation and abjuration; and so our pitiful mother holy
church rejoicing over the sinner showing penitence, desiring
to bring back to the shepherd, with the others, the returned
and recovered sheep which had wandered and gone astray in
the desert, condemned this Joan to prison to do salutary penance;
but she was hardly there any time before the fire of her
pride, which seemed to be extinguished, rekindled in her with
pestilential flames by the breathings of the enemy, and the
said unhappy woman immediately fell back into the errors and
false extravagances which she had before uttered and afterwards
revoked and abjured, as has been said. For which
causes, according to what the judgements and institutions of
holy church ordain, in order that henceforward she might not
contaminate the poor members of Jesus Christ, she was again
publicly preached to, and as she had fallen back into the
crimes and faults she was accustomed, left to secular justice,
which immediately condemned her to be burned. And then
she, seeing her end drawing near, recognized clearly that the
spirits which she had said had appeared to her many times
before were wicked and lying spirits, and that the promises
which these spirits had formerly made to her of delivering her
were false, and so she confessed it to have been a mockery and
deceit; and she was taken by the said lay justice to the old
market-place in the town of Rouen, and was there publicly
burnt in the sight of all the people."</p>

<p>For the good rule, demising and surety of the King's person,
and draught of him to virtue and cunning, and eschewing of
anything that might give hindrance or let thereto, or cause
any charge, default, or blame to be laid upon the Earl of
Warwick at any time without his desert, he, considering that
peril and business of his charge about the King's person
groweth so that that authority and power given to him before
sufficeth him not without more thereto, desireth therefore these
things that follow.</p>

<p>First, that considering that the charge of the rule, demising
and governance, and also of nurture of the King's person
resteth upon the said Earl while it shall like the King, and the
peril, danger, and blame if any lack or default were in any of
these, the which lack or default might be caused by ungodly or
unvirtuous men, if any such were about his person; he
desireth therefore, for the good of the King, and for his own
surety, to have power and authority to name, ordain, and
assign, and for that cause that shall be thought to him reasonable,
to remove those that shall be about the King's person, of
what estate or condition that they be, not intending to comprehend
in this desire the Steward, Chamberlain, Treasurer, Controller,
nor Serjeant of offices, save such as serve the King's
person and for his mouth.</p>

<p><i>Responsio.</i>&mdash;As toward the naming, ordinance, and assignation
beforesaid, it is agreed, so that he take in none of the four
knights nor squires for the body without the advice of my
Lord of Bedford, him being in England, and him being out, of
my Lord of Gloucester, and of the remnant of the King's
Council.</p>

<p>Item, the said Earl desireth that where he shall have any
person in his discretion suspect of misgovernance, and not
behoveful nor expedient to be about the King, except the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_41" title="41">41</a>estates of the house, that he may put them from exercise and
occupation of the King's service, till that he shall more have
speech with my Lords of Bedford or of Gloucester, and with
the other Lords of the King's Council, to that end that, the
default of any such person known unto him, [they] shall more
ordain thereupon as them shall think expedient and behoveful.</p>

<p><i>Responsio.</i>&mdash;It is agreed as it is desired....</p>

<p>Item, that considering how, blessed be God, the King is
growing in years, in stature of his person, and also in conceit
and knowledge of his high and royal authority and estate, the
which naturally causing him, and from day to day as he
groweth shall cause him, more and more to grudge with
chastising, and to loath it, so that it may reasonably be
doubted lest he would conceive against the said Earl, or any
other that would take upon him to chastise him for his
defaults, displeasure, or indignation therefore, the which, without
due assistance, is not easy to be borne. It like, therefore,
to my Lord of Gloucester, and to all the Lords of the King's
Council, to promise to the said Earl, and assure him, that they
shall firmly and truly assist him in the exercise of the charge
and occupation that he hath about the King's person, namely
in chastising of him for his defaults, and support the said
Earl therein; and if the King at any time would conceive
indignation against the said Earl, my said Lord of Gloucester,
and Lords, shall do all their true diligence and power to remove
the King therefrom.</p>

<p><i>Responsio.</i>&mdash;It is agreed as it is desired.</p>

<p>Item, the said Earl desireth that forasmuch as it shall be
necessary to remove the King's person at divers times into
sundry places, as the cases may require, that he may have
power and authority to remove the King, by his discretion,
into what place he thinketh necessary for the health of his
body and surety of his person.</p>

<p><i>Responsio.</i>&mdash;It is agreed as it is desired....</p>

<p>Item, forasmuch as the said Earl hath knowledge that in
speech that hath been had unto the King at part and in privy,
not in the hearing of the said Earl nor any of the knights
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_42" title="42">42</a>set about his person, nor assigned by the said Earl, he hath been
stirred by some from his learning, and spoken to of divers matters
not behoveful, the said Earl doubting the harm that might fall
to the King, and the inconvenience that might ensue of such
speech at part as if it were suffered; desireth that in all speech
to be had with the King, he or one of the four knights, or
some person to be assigned by the said Earl, be present and
privy to it.</p>

<p><i>Responsio.</i>&mdash;This article is agreed, excepting such persons as
for nighness of blood, and for their estate, owe of reason to be
suffered to speak with the King.</p>

<p>Item, to the intent that it may be known to the King that it
proceedeth of the assent, advice and agreement of my Lord of
Gloucester, and all my Lords of the King's Council, that the
King be chastised for his defaults or trespasses, and that for awe
thereof he forbear the more to do amiss, and intend the more
busily to virtue and to learning, the said Earl desireth that my
Lord of Gloucester, and my said other Lords of the Council,
or great part of them, that is to say, the Chancellor and
Treasurer, and of every estate in the Council, spiritual and
temporal, some come to the King's presence, and there to make
to be declared to him their agreement in that behalf.</p>

<p><i>Responsio.</i>&mdash;When the King cometh next to London, all his
Council shall come to his presence, and there this shall be
declared to him.</p>

<p>Item, the said Earl, that all his days hath, above all other
earthy things, desired, and ever shall to keep his truth and
worship unblemished and unhurt, and may not for all that let
[prevent] malicious and untrue men to make informations of his
person, such as they may not, nor dare not, stand by, nor be not
true, beseecheth therefore my Lord of Gloucester and all my said
Lords of the Council, that if they, or any of them, have been
informed of anything that may be laid to his charge or
default, and namely in his occupation and rule about the King's
person, that the said Earl may have knowledge thereof, to the
intent that he may answer thereto, and not dwell in heavy or
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_43" title="43">43</a>sinister conceit or opinion, without his desert and without
answer.</p>

<p>To the King our Sovereign Lord; Shewen meekly your
true liege people, here by your authority royal in this present
Parliament for the Commons of this your noble realm
assembled; how that a sickness called the Pestilence, universally
through this your realm runneth more commonly than
hath been usual before this time, the which is an infirmity
most infective; and the presence of such so infect most to be
eschewed, as by noble physicians and wise philosophers before
this time plainly it hath been determined and as experience
daily sheweth. Wherefore we your poor liege people, above
all earthly thing tendering and desiring the health and welfare
of your most noble person, beseech your most noble grace, in
conserving of your most noble person and in comfort of us all,
in eschewing of any such infection to you to fall, which God
defend, graciously to conceive how where that any of your said
Commons, holding of you by Knight's service, oweth in doing
you homage, by your gracious sufferance, to kiss you, to
ordain and grant by the authority of this present Parliament,
that every of your said lieges, in doing of their said homage,
may omit the said kissing of you....</p>

Forasmuch as the right reverend father in God the Archbishop
of Canterbury and the reverend father in God the bishop of
London, considering the great abuses that have been of long
time within our city of London that many and divers persons,
not sufficiently instructed in grammar, presuming to hold common
grammar schools in great deceit as well unto their
scholars as unto the friends that find them to school, have of
their great wisdom set and ordained five schools of grammar,
and no more, within our said city. One within the churchyard
of St. Paul's, another within the collegiate church of St. Martin,
the third in Bow church, the fourth in the church of St. Dunstan
in the East, the fifth in our hospital of St. Anthony within
our said city; the which they have openly declared sufficient,
as by their letters patent thereupon made it appeareth
more at large. We, in consideration of the premises, have
thereunto granted our royal will and assent. Wherefore we

by the same our letters unto all our subjects of our said city

<p>[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The author of this and other extracts relating to the loss of Normandy
was Jacques le Bouvier, surnamed Berry, the first King-of-Arms of Charles VII.
of France.]</p>


<p>The duke of Bretagne everywhere sent to all his subjects,
well-wishers, friends and allies, asking them to be so good as
to help him to avenge himself upon the English, and to help
him to recover his town of Foug&egrave;res. And on this occasion to
please the said duke of Bretagne, M. Jehan de Bressay, knight,
a native of the country of Anjou, Robert de Flocques, esquire
of the country of Normandy, bailly of Evreux, Jacques de
Clermont, esquire of the country of Dauphin&eacute; and lord of
Mannay, and Guillaume le Vigars, esquire, made the attempt
to take the town and castle of Pont de l'Arche, on the river
Seine, by means of a merchant of Louviers who often took a
cart by the said Pont de l'Arche to go to Rouen, which is
about four short leagues above it.... And the said merchant,
with two others, upon a day in the month of May, being
the Thursday before the Ascension of our Lord, set out from
Louviers and went to take his cart, as he had often done,
through the town of Pont de l'Arche, pretending that he was
taking merchandize to Rouen; and in passing he asked the
porter of the castle to be so good as to open the gate of the
castle for him very early next morning, and he would give him
a good gratuity, for he made him believe that he wished to
return speedily to Louviers for some merchandize. And so the
merchant passed through the town; and he returned about the
hour of midnight, accompanied by many of the said ambuscade
on foot; and they lodged at an inn in the country, adjoining
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" title="49">49</a>the castle. They entered into the said inn secretly, where they
found the wife in bed alone, (who was exceedingly terrified),
for her husband was absent on his business. And when it
drew near daybreak, the said merchant went all alone to call
the said porter, who came to open the gate of the castle and
the bulwark for him, as he had promised the day before; and
immediately two persons came out of the inn to come to the
bulwark along with the merchant, of whom the said porter was
apprehensive when he saw them approach. But the said
merchant told him that they were people of Louviers, and then
he was satisfied. Then the merchant entered with all his
wares, leaving the cart upon the bridge until such time as he
had thrown upon the ground for his (the porter's) reward, two
bretons and a placque; and as he was stooping to gather them,
the merchant killed him with a dagger.... The men of the
castle heard the noise, and an Englishman came down in his
night-shirt, (a handsome fellow, young and brave), who
attempted to raise the bridge of the said castle, because he saw
that the said bulwark was already lost; but the said merchant
hastened to go to him, and killed him before he could raise the
bridge, which was a pity, for he was one of the bravest and
most active young men of his party. And thus the castle was
won.</p>

<p>And then all the foot-soldiers went along the bridge making
great shouts, to enter the town which they took; for the
greater part of the inhabitants were still in their beds, excepting
one Englishman, who valiantly and for a long time
defended the gate of the bridge, to hinder them from entering;
but in the end he was killed and the town taken.</p>

THE ENGLISH, AND WHY; AND OF THE CAPTURE
OF VERNEUIL (1449).</h2></div>

<p class="subheading"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;"Le recouvrement de Normandie," printed in <i>Reductio
Normannie, pp. 254 et seq.</i> (Rolls Series, 1863.)</p>


<p>The King of France was duly informed of the war which
the English made upon the realm of Scotland, which was
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" title="50">50</a>comprehended in the truce; and also of the war which they
made by sea upon the King of Spain, his ally, who was also
in the said truce; and in like manner upon his subjects of
La Rochelle and Dieppe, and elsewhere.... For as long
as the truce had continued, the English came from Mantes,
Verneuil and Loigny upon the roads from Paris and Orleans,
robbing and murdering the merchants and the honest people
who were travelling along the roads ... and they went by
night to their houses in the open country, and took prisoners
in their beds the gentlemen who were of the party of the King
of France, cut their throats and murdered them vilely in their
beds. And it was their custom to cut the throats of these
gentlemen during the said truce. And these malefactors were
called <i>False-Faces</i>, because, when they did these things, they
disguised themselves with disorderly and frightful dresses and
headpieces, painted with various colours, and other clothes, so
that they should not be known....</p>

<p>At this time a miller of the town of Verneuil who had his
mill opposite the walls of the town, was beaten by an
Englishman who was going the rounds, because he was
asleep at his post. And for revenge he went to the bailly of
Evreux, and, after a certain treaty made between them, he
promised that he would admit him within the said town.
Hereupon assembled messire Pierre de Bressay, seneschal of
Poitou, the said bailly of Evreux, Jacques de Clermont and
others. They came on horseback and found themselves on
Sunday 19th July in this year, at break of day, near the walls
of the said town. The said miller (who had been on watch
that night) made the others who kept watch with him go
down from the wall sooner than usual, because (in order to
accomplish his purpose) he made them believe that, as it was
Sunday, they should hasten to go, the bell having rung for
Mass. By the help of the miller the French placed their
ladders to the right of the wall, and entered the town without
anyone noticing them. Six score Englishmen were within, of
whom some were slain and taken prisoners, and the others
betook themselves in great haste to the keep of the castle.</p>

<p>... On the fifteenth of April they (the French) came up
with the English in a field near a village named Formigny,
between Carentan [Triviers] and Bayeux. And when the said
English saw and perceived them, they put themselves in order
of battle, and sent very hastily for the said Matthew Gough,
who had left them that morning to go to Bayeux, and he
immediately returned. And then the French and the English
were one in the presence of the other, for the space of three
hours, skirmishing. And in the meantime the English made
large holes and trenches with their daggers and swords before
them, in order that the French and their horses should
stumble if they attacked them. And at the distance of a long
bowshot behind the English there was a little river between
them, with a great abundance of gardens full of various trees,
as apples, pears, elms, and other trees; and they encamped in
this place because they could not be attacked in the rear.</p>

<p>And in the meantime the lord of Richmond, Constable of
France, the lord of Laval, the lord of Loheac, marshal of
France, the lord of Orval, the marshal of Bretaigne, the lord
of Saint-Severe, and many others set out from Triviers, where
they had slept that night, and joined them, to the number of
three hundred lances, and the archers. And when the said
English saw them come, they left the field, and the troops
marched and came to the river to place it behind them; for
they were afraid of the Constable's company, who had slept
the night at a village named Triviers, and had put himself in
order of battle upon the arrival of the said English at a wind-mill
above the said Formigny. And then marched the troops
of the said lord of Clermont and his company, in which were
from five to six hundred lances and the archers, and they
charged the said English, as did also those of the said Constable,
who crossed the river by a ford and a little bridge of
stone. And there they attacked the English on both sides
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" title="52">52</a>very bravely, so that in the end they discomfited them close
by the said river.</p>

<p>And there there were killed, by the report of the heralds
who were there, and of the priests and good people who
buried them, three thousand seven hundred and seventy-four
English.</p>

<p>I beseech our Lord in Heaven, the maker of all the
world, to bless you, and to send you ever grace to love him,
and to dread him; to the which, as far as a father may charge
his child, I both charge you, and pray you to set all spirits
and wits to do, and to know his holy laws and commandments,
by the which ye shall with his great mercy pass all the
great tempests and troubles of this wretched world. And that
also, wittingly, ye do nothing for love or dread of any earthly
creature that should displease him. And there as any frailty
maketh you to fall, beseech his mercy soon to call you to him
again with repentance, satisfaction, and contrition of your heart
never more in will to offend him.</p>

<p>Secondly, next him, above all earthly thing, to be true liege
man in heart, in will, in thought, in deed unto the King our
most high and dread Sovereign Lord, to whom both ye and
I be so much bound to; charging you, as father can and
may, rather to die than be the contrary, or to know any thing
that were against the welfare or prosperity of his most royal
person, but that as far as your body and life may stretch, ye
live and die to defend it, and to let his highness have knowledge
thereof in all the haste ye can.</p>

<p>Thirdly, in the same wise, I charge you, my dear son, as ye
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" title="53">53</a>be bound by the commandment of God to do, to love, to
worship your lady and mother, and also that ye obey always
her commandments, and to believe her counsels and advices
in all your works, the which dread not but shall be best
and truest to you. And if any other body would stir you to
the contrary, to flee the counsel in any wise, for ye shall find
it nought and evil.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as far as father may and can, I charge you in
any wise to flee the company and counsel of proud men, of
covetous men, and of flattering men, the more especially and
mightily to withstand them, and not to draw, nor to meddle
with them, with all your might and power. And to draw to
you and to your company good and virtuous men, and such as
be of good conversation, and of truth, and by them shall ye
never be deceived, nor repent you of. Moreover, never follow
your own wit in no wise, but in all your works, of such folks
as I write of above, ask your advice and counsel; and
doing thus, with the mercy of God, ye shall do right well, and
live in right much worship, and great heart's rest and ease.
And I will be to you as good lord and father as my heart can
think.</p>

<p>And last of all, as heartily and as lovingly as ever father
blessed his child in earth, I give you the blessing of our Lord
and of me, which of his infinite mercy increase you in all
virtue and good living. And that your blood may by his
grace from kindred to kindred multiply in this earth to his
service, in such wise as after the departing from this wretched

unto the coast of Kent full near Dover with his two ships and a
little spinner; the which spinner he sent with certain letters to
certain of his trusted men unto Calais wards, to know how he
should be received; and with him met a ship called <i>Nicolas of
the Tower</i>, with other ships waiting on him, and by them that
were in the spinner the master of the <i>Nicolas</i> had knowledge
of the duke's coming. And when he espied the duke's ships,
he sent forth his boat to know what they were, and the duke
himself spake to them, and said, he was by the King's commandment
sent to Calais wards, etc.</p>

<p>And they said he must speak with their master. And so he,
with two or three of his men, went forth with them in their
boat to the <i>Nicolas</i>; and when he come, the master bade him
"Welcome, Traitor," as men say; and further the master
desired to know if the shipmen would hold with the duke,
and they sent word they would not in no wise; and so he
was in the <i>Nicolas</i> till Saturday next following.</p>

<p>Some say he wrote much things to be delivered to the
King, but that is not verily known. He had his confessor
with him, etc.</p>

<p>And some say he was arraigned in the ship on their manner
upon the impeachments and found guilty, etc.</p>

<p>Also he asked the name of the ship, and when he knew it,
he remembered Stacy that said, if he might escape the danger
of the Tower, he should be safe; and then his heart failed
him, for he thought he was deceived, and in the sight of all
his men he was drawn out of the great ship in to the boat;
and there was an axe and a block, and one of the lewdest of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_55" title="55">55</a>the ship bid him lay down his head, and he should be fair
fared with and die on a sword; and took a rusty sword, and
smote off his head within half a dozen strokes, and took away
his gown of russet, and his doublet of velvet mailed, and laid
his body on the sands of Dover; and some say his head was
set on a pole by it....</p>

<p>And the sheriff of Kent doth watch the body, and sent his
under-sheriff to the judges to know what to do, and also to the
King what shall be done.</p>

<p>A.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A Proclamation made by Jack Cade, Captain of
the Rebels in Kent.</span></p>

<p>These be the points, causes and mischiefs of gathering and
assembling of us the King's liege men of Kent, the iiij day
of June the year of our Lord <span class="smcap">M</span>iiijcl, the which we trust to
Almighty God to remedy, with the help and the grace of God
and of our sovereign lord the King, and the poor commons of
England, and else we shall die therefore:</p>

<p>We, considering that the King our sovereign lord, by the
insatiable covetous malicious pomps, and false and of nought
brought up certain persons, that daily and nightly is about his
highness, and daily inform him that good is evil and evil is
good, as Scripture witnesseth, <i>Ve vobis qui dicitis bonum malum
et malum bonum</i>.</p>

<p>Item, they say that our sovereign lord is above his laws to
his pleasure, and he may make it and break it as him list,
without any distinction. The contrary is true, and else he
should not have sworn to keep it, the which we conceived for
the highest point of treason that any subject may do to make
his prince run into perjury.</p>

<p>Item, they say that the commons of England would first
destroy the King's friends and afterwards himself, and then
bring the Duke of York to be King....</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_56" title="56">56</a>
Item, they say the King should live upon his commons and
that their bodies and goods be the King's; the contrary is
true, for then needed him never parliament to sit to ask good
of his commons.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Item, it is to be remedied that the false traitors will suffer
no man to come into the King's presence for no cause without
bribes where none ought to be had, nor no bribery about the
King's person, but that any man might have his coming to
him to ask him grace or judgement in such case as the King
may give.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Item, the law serveth of nought else in these days but for
to do wrong....</p>

<p>Item, we say our sovereign lord may understand that his
false council hath lost his law, his merchandise is lost, his
common people is destroyed, the sea is lost, France is lost, the
King himself is so set that he may not pay for his meat and
drink, and he oweth more than ever any King of England
owed, for daily his traitors about him, where anything should
come to him by his laws, anon they ask it from him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Item, his true commons desire that he will avoid from him
all the false progeny and affinity of the Duke of Suffolk...
and to take about his noble person his true blood of his royal
realm, that is to say, the high and mighty prince the Duke of
York, exiled from our sovereign lord's person by the noising
of the false traitor, the Duke of Suffolk and his affinity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Item, taking of wheat and other grains, beef, mutton, and
other victual, the which is unbearable hurt to the commons,
without provision of our sovereign lord and his true council,
for his commons may no longer bear it.</p>

<p>Item, the statute upon the labourers and the great extortioners
of Kent.</p>



<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_57" title="57">57</a></p>


<p>B.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Capture and Death of Cade.</span></p>

<p>... Then the commons of Kent arose and had chosen them
a captain the which named himself John Mortimer, whose very
true name was John Cade, and he was an Irishman, and so he
come to Blackheath with the commons of Kent. And the King
with all his lords made them ready with all their power for to
withstand him.... And the Mayor of London with the
commons of the city came unto the King beseeching him that
he would tarry in the city and they would live and die with
him and pay for the cost of his household an half year; but he
would not, but took his journey to Kenilworth. And when the
King was gone, the captain with the commons of Kent came
again to Blackheath. And the iij<sup>rd</sup> day of July he came to
London; and as soon as they came to London they robbed
Phillip Malpas. And the iiij<sup>th</sup> day of July he beheaded
Crowmer and another man at Mile End; and the same day at
afternoon the Lord Say was fetched out of the Tower to the
Guild Hall for the mayor to have judgement, and when he
came before the mayor he said he would be judged by his
peers. And then the commons of Kent took him from the
officers and led him to the Standard in Cheap and there smote
off his head. And then the captain did draw him through
London, and over London Bridge to Saint Thomas, and there
he was hanged and quartered, and his head and Crowmer's
head and another man's head were set on London Bridge....
And the v<sup>th</sup> day of July at night (and being Sunday)
the commons of London set upon the commons of Kent, for
they began to rob.... Then the xij<sup>th</sup> day of July was in
every shire proclaimed that what man that could take the
aforesaid captain and bring him to the King quick or dead,
should have a thousand marks, and as for any man that belonged
to him x marks; for it was openly known that his name was
not Mortimer, his name was John Cade.... And so one
Alexander Iden, a squire of Kent, took him in a garden in
Southsea the xiij<sup>th</sup> day of July; and in the taking of him he
was hurt and died that same night, and on the morrow he was
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_58" title="58">58</a>brought into the King's Bench, and after was drawn through
London and his head set on London Bridge.</p>

<p>Master Paston, we commend us unto you, letting you know
the Sheriff is not so whole as he was, for now he will show but
a part of his friendship. And also there is great press of
people and few friends, as far as we can feel yet.... Also
the Sheriff informed us that he hath writing from the King
that he shall make such a panel to acquit Lord Molynes.
And also he told us, and as far as we can conceive and feel,
the Sheriff will panel gentlemen to acquit the lord, and jurors
to acquit his men; and we suppose that this is by the motion
and means of the other party. And if any means of treaty
be proferred, we know not what means should be to your
pleasure. And therefore we would fain have more knowledge,
if ye think it were to do.</p>

<p>Right reverend and worshipful master, I recommend me

this time is to give you relation of the untrue demeaning of
this our <i>determiner</i>, by the partiality of the judges of it; for
when the council of the city of Norwich, of the town of

plaintiffs had put in and declared, both by writing and by
word before the judges, the lawful exceptions in many wise,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_59" title="59">59</a>the judges by their wilfullness might not find in their heart
not as much as a beck nor a twinkling of their eye toward, but
took it to derision. God reform such partiality.... It was the
most partial place of all the shire, and thither were called all
the friends, knights and squires and gentlemen that would in
no wise do otherwise than they would. And the said Tudenham,
Heydon and other oppressors of their set came down
hither with four hundred horse and more; and considering
how their well-willers were there assembled at their instance,
it had been right jeopardous and fearful for any of the plaintiffs
to have been present....</p>

<p>These be divers of the riots and offences done in the hundred
of Blofeld in the county of Norfolk, and in other towns by
Robert Ledham, of Wytton by Blofeld, in the county of
Norfolk.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>In primis</i>, on the Monday next before Easter day and the
shire day, the thirtieth year of our sovereign lord the King, ten
persons of the said rioters, with a brother of the wife of the
said Robert Ledham, lay in wait in the highway under Thorpe
wood upon Phillip Berney, esquire, and his man coming from
the shire, and shot at him and smote the horse of the said
Phillip with arrows, and then overrode him, and took him and
beat him and spoiled him. And for their excuse of this riot,
they led him to the Bishop of Norwich, asking surety of the
peace where they had never warrant him to arrest. Which
affray shortened the life-days of the said Phillip, which died
within short time after the said affray.</p>

<p>Item, three of the said riotous fellowship the same day,
year, and place, lay in wait upon Edmond Brown, gentleman,
and with naked swords and other weapons fought with him by
the space of one quarter of an hour, and took and spoiled him,
and kept him as long as they list, and after that let him go.</p>


<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_60" title="60">60</a>
Item, forty of the said riotous fellowship, by the commandment
of the same Robert Ledham, jacked and saletted, with
bows and arrows, bills, and glaives upon Maundy Thursday,
at four of the clock at afternoon, the same year, coming to the
White Friars in Norwich, and would have broken their gates
and doors, feigning them that they would hear their evensong.
Where they were answered such service was none used to be
there, nor within the said city at that time of the day, and
prayed them to depart; and they answered and said that afore
their departing they would have some persons out of that
place, quick or dead, inasmuch the said friars were fain to
keep their place with force. And the mayor and the sheriff of
the said city were fain to arraign a power to resist the said
riots, which to them on that holy time was tedious and heinous
considering the loss and letting of the holy service of that holy
night. And thereupon the said rioters departed.</p>

<p>Item, the said Robert Ledham on the Monday next after
Easter day, the same year, took from one John Wilton four
cattle for rent arrear as he said, and killed them, and laid them
in salt, and afterwards ate them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Item, in likewise the said Robert Ledham and his men
assaulted one John Coke of Witton, in breaking up his doors
at eleven of the clock at night, and with their swords maimed
him and gave him seven great wounds, and took from him
certain goods and chattels, of which he had, nor yet hath, no
remedy nor restitution.</p>

<p>Item, the same day and year they beat the mother of the
same John Coke, she being four score years of age and more,
and smote her upon the crown of her head with a sword; of
which hurt she might never be healed to the day of her death.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Item, on Mid Lent Sunday, the thirtieth year of our sovereign
Lord the King that now is, Robert Dallyng, Robert Church,
Robert Taillor, Henry Bang, Adam at More, with others
unknown, by the commandment and assent of the said Robert
Ledham, made affray upon Henry Smith and Thomas Chamber
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_61" title="61">61</a>at South Birlingham, the said Henry and Thomas at that time
kneeling to see the using of the mass, and then and there would
have killed the said Henry and Thomas at the priest's back,
unless they had been prevented.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Item, the said Robert Ledham, continuing in this wise,
called unto him his said misgoverned fellowship, considering
the absence of many of the well-ruled of the said hundred, of
afore-cast malice concocted, purposed and laboured to the
Sheriff of the shire that the said Robert Church, one of the
said riotous fellowship, was made baillie of the hundred; and
after caused the same Roger to be beginner of arising and to
take upon him to be a captain and to excite the people of the
country thereto. And thereupon, by covin of the said Robert
Ledham, to impeach all these said well-ruled persons, and as
well other divers substantial men of good fame and good
governance that was hated by the said Robert Ledham, and
promising the said Roger harmless and to sue his pardon by
the men of Danyell; to the which promise the said Roger
agreed, and was arrested and taken by the said Ledham by
covin betwixt them, and impeached such persons as they list,
to the intent that the said substantial men of the country
should be by that means so troubled and endangered that they
should not be of power to let and resist the misrule of the said
Ledham and his misgoverned fellowship, the which matter is
confessed by the said Robert Church.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Item, six or seven of the said Ledham's men daily, both
work day and holy day, use to go about in the country with
bows and arrows, shooting and playing in many closes among
men's cattle, going from alehouse to alehouse and menacing
such as they hated, and sought occasion to quarrel and
debate.</p>

<p>Item, notwithstanding that all the livelihood that the said
Ledham hath passeth not &pound;20, besides the repairs and out-charges,
and that he hath no cunning nor true means of getting
of any good in this country, as far as any man may conceive,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_62" title="62">62</a>and yet keepeth in his house daily twenty men, besides women
and great multitude of such misgoverned people as [have] been
resorting to him, as is above said, to the which he giveth
clothing, and yet beside that he giveth to others that be not
dwelling in his household; and of the said men there passeth
not eight that use occupation of husbandry; and all they that
use husbandry, as well as other, be jacked and saletted ready
for war, which in this country is thought right strange, and is
verily so conceived that he may not keep this countenance by
no good means.</p>

<p>Item, the said Ledham, hath a <i>supersedeas</i> out of the
Chancery for him and divers of his men, that no warrant of
justice of peace may be served against him.</p>

<p>[<i>A report, drawn up by the chief persons in the County of Kildare,
to Richard Duke of York, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.</i>]</p>


<p>Right high and mighty Prince and our right gracious lord,
Richard Duke of York, we recommend us unto you as lowly
as we can or may; and please your gracious Highness to be
advertised that the land of Ireland was never at the point
finally to be destroyed, since the conquest of this land, as it is
now, for the true liege people in these parts dare nor may not
appear to the King our sovereign lord's courts in the said
land, nor none of the true liege people there to go nor ride to
market towns nor other places, for dread of being slain, taken
or spoiled of their goods; also the misrule and misgovernance
had, done and daily continued by divers gentlemen of the
county and your liberty of Meath and the county of Kildare,
and namely because of a variance between the earl of Wiltshire,
lieutenant of the said land, and Thomas Fitzmaurice of
the Geraldines for the title of the manors of Maynooth and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_63" title="63">63</a>Rathmore in the county of Kildare.... For Henry Bonyn
knight, constituted Treasurer of the said land under the great
Seal, assembling with him Edmund Butler cousin germane to
the said Earl of Wiltshire and William Butler, cousin to the
said Earl, with their following, of the which the most part was
Irish enemies and English rebels, came unto the said County
of Kildare and there burnt and destroyed divers and many
towns and parish churches of the true liege people, and took
divers of them prisoners and spoiled them of their goods. And
after the departure of the said Henry and Edmund, the said
William ... did so great oppression in the said county of
Kildare and in the county and liberty of Meath that twenty-seven
towns and more which was well inhabited on the feast
of St. Michael's last passed are now wasted and destroyed....
Also please your Highness to be advertised that the said
William Butler, Nicolas Wogan, David Wogan and Richard
Wogan came, with divers Irish enemies and English rebels to
the castle of Rathcoffy there, as Ann Wogan sometime wife to
Oliver Eustace, then being the King's widow,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> was dwelling,
and burnt the gates of the said place, and took her with them
and Edward Eustace, son and heir to the said Oliver ... of
the age of eight years, and yet holdeth them prisoners, and
took goods and chattels of the said Anne to the value of five
hundred marks.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you might plainly perceive public and
intestine broils fermenting among the princes and nobles of
the realm, so much so, that in the words of the Gospel,
"Brother was divided against brother and father against
father"; one party adhering to the King, while the other,
being attached to the said duke by blood or by ties of duty,
sided with him. And not only among princes and people had
such a spirit of contention arisen, but even in every society,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_64" title="64">64</a>whether chapter, college, or convent, had this unhappy plague
of division effected an entrance; so much so, that brother
could hardly with any degree of security admit brother into
his confidence, or friend a friend, nor could any one reveal the
secret of his conscience without giving offence. The consequence
was that, from and after this period of time, the combatants
on both sides, uniting their respective forces together,
attacked each other whenever they happened to meet, and
quite in accordance with the doubtful issue of warfare, now
the one and now the other for the moment gained the victory,
while fortune was continually shifting her position. In the
meantime, however, the slaughter of men was immense; for
besides the dukes, earls, barons, and distinguished warriors
who were cruelly slain, multitudes almost innumerable of the
common people died of their wounds. Such was the state of
the kingdom for nearly ten years.</p>

<p>As touching tidings, please it you to wit that at the Prince's
coming to Windsor, the Duke of Buckingham took him in his
arms and presented him to the King in godly wise, beseeching
the King to bless him; and the King gave no manner of
answer. Nevertheless the Duke abode still with the Prince
by the King; and when he could no manner answer have, the
Queen come in, and took the Prince in her arms and presented
him in like form as the Duke had done, desiring that he
should bless it; but all their labour was in vain, for they
departed thence without any answer or countenance saving
only that once he looked on the Prince and cast down his eyes
again, without any more.</p>

<p>Be it known and had in mind that the 21st day of May the
twenty-third year of the reign of King Henry the sixth, our
Sovereign Lord the King took his journey from Westminster
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_66" title="66">66</a>toward Saint Albans, and rested at Watford all night; and on
the morrow betimes he came to Saint Albans, and with him...
gentlemen and yeomen to the number of two thousand and
more. And upon the twenty-second day of the said month
above rehearsed assembled the Duke of York, and with him
came in company the Earl of Salisbury, the Earl of Warwick
with divers knights and squires unto their party into the field,
called the Key Field, beside Saint Albans. Furthermore, our
said sovereign Lord the King, hearing and knowing of the
said Duke's coming with other Lords aforesaid, pitched his
banner at the place called Boslawe in Saint Peter Street,
which place was called aforetime Sandiford, and commandeth
the ward and barriers to be kept in strong wise; the aforesaid
Duke of York abiding in the field aforesaid from seven of the
clock in the morning till it was almost ten without any stroke
smitten on either party. The said Duke sent to the King our
sovereign Lord, by the advice of his Council, praying and
beseeching him to take him as his true man and humble subject;
and to consider and to tender at the reverence of
Almighty God, and in way of charity the true intent of his
coming&mdash;to be good and gracious sovereign Lord to his liegemen,
which with all their power and might will be ready at all
times to live and die with him in his right.</p>

<p>"Moreover, gracious Lord, please it your Majesty Royal of
your great goodness and righteousness to incline your will to
hear and feel the righteous party of us your subjects and liegemen;
first, praying and beseeching to our Lord Jesus of his
high and mighty power to give unto you virtue and prudence,
and that through the mediation of the glorious martyr Saint
Alban to give you very knowledge to know the intent of our
assembling at this time; for God that is in Heaven knoweth
that our intent is rightful and true. And therefore we pray
unto Almighty Lord Jesus, these words&mdash;<i>Domine sis clipeus
defensionis nostr&aelig;</i>. Wherefore, gracious Lord, please it your
high Majesty to deliver such as we will accuse, and they to
have like as they have deserved and done, and ye to be
honoured and worshipped as most rightful King, our governor.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_67" title="67">67</a>For and we shall now at this time be promised, as afore this
time is not unknown, of promises broken which full faith fully
hath been promised, and there upon great oaths made, we will
not now cease for none such promise, surety, nor other, till we
have them which have deserved death, or else we to die
therefore."</p>

<p>And to that answered the King our sovereign Lord and
said: "I, King Henry, charge and command that no manner
of person, of what degree, or state, or condition that ever he
be, abide not, but void the field, and not be so hardy to make
any resistance against me in mine own realm; for I shall
know what traitor dare be so bold to raise a people in mine
own land, wherefore I am in great distress and heaviness.
And by the faith that I owe to Saint Edward, and to the
Crown of England, I shall destroy them every mother's son,
and they be hanged, and drawn, and quartered, that they may
be taken afterward, of them to have example to all such
traitors to beware to make any such rising of people within
my land, and so traitorously to abide their King and governor.
And for a conclusion, rather than they shall have any Lord
here with me at this time, I shall this day, for their sake, and
in this quarrel myself live or die."</p>

<p>Which answer come to the Duke of York, the which Duke,
by the advice of the Lords of his Council, said unto them these
words: "The King our sovereign Lord will not be reformed
at our beseeching nor prayer, nor will not understand the
intent that we be come hither and assembled for and
gathered at this time; but only his full purpose, and there
none other way but that he will with all his power pursue us,
and if taken, to give us a shameful death, losing our livelihood
and goods, and our heirs shamed for ever. And therefore,
since it will be none otherwise but that we shall utterly
die, better it is for us to die in the field than cowardly to be put
to a great rebuke and a shameful death; moreover, considering
in what peril England stands in at this hour, therefore
every man help to help power for the right thereof, to redress
the mischief that now reigneth, and to quit us like men in this
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_68" title="68">68</a>quarrel; praying to that Lord that is King of Glory, that
reigneth in the Kingdom celestial, to keep us and save us this
day in our right, and through the help of His holy grace we
may be made strong to withstand the great, abominable and
cruel malice of them that purpose fully to destroy us with
shameful death. We therefore, Lord, pray to Thee to be our
comfort and Defender, saying the word aforesaid, <i>Domine sis
clipeus defensionis nostr&aelig;</i>."</p>

<p>And when this was said, the said Duke of York, and the said
Earl of Salisbury, and the Earl of Warwick, between eleven
and twelve of the clock at noon, they broke into the town in
three divers places and several places of the aforesaid street.
The King being then in the place of Edmond Westby hundredor
of the said town of Saint Albans, commandeth to slay
all manner men of lords, knights, and squires and yeomen that
might be taken of the foresaid Duke of York. This done, the
foresaid Lord Clifford kept strongly the barriers that the said
Duke of York might not in any wise, with all the power that
he had, enter nor break into the town. The Earl of Warwick,
knowing thereof, took and gathered his men together, and
furiously brake in by the garden sides between the sign of the
Key and the sign of the Chequer in Holwell street; and anon
as they were within the town, suddenly they blew up trumpets,
and set a cry with a shout and a great voice, "A Warwick!
A Warwick! A Warwick!" and unto that time the Duke of
York might never have entry into the town; and they with
strong hand kept it, and mightily fought together, and anon,
forthwith after the breaking in, they set on them manfully.
And of them that were slain and buried in Saint Albans,
forty-eight. And at this same time were hurt Lords of name&mdash;the
King, our sovereign Lord, in the neck with an arrow;
the Duke of Buckingham, with an arrow in the visage; the
Lord of Stafford in the hand, with an arrow; the lord of
Dorset, sore hurt that he might not go, but he was carried
home in a cart; and Wenlock, knight, in like wise in a cart
sore hurt; and other divers knights and squires sore hurt. The
Earl of Wiltshire, Thorpe, and many others fled, and left their
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_69" title="69">69</a>harness behind them cowardly, and the substance of the King's
party were despoiled of horse and harness. This done, the
said Lords, that is to wit, the Duke of York, the Earl of Salisbury,
the Earl of Warwick, come to the King, our Sovereign
Lord, and on their knees besought him of grace and forgiveness
of that they had done in his presence, and besought him
of his Highness to take them as his true liegemen, saying that
they never intended hurt to his own person, and therefore the
King our sovereign Lord took them to grace, and so desired
them to cease their people, and that there should no more
harm be done; and they obeyed his commandment, and let
made a cry in the King's name that all manner of people
should cease and not so hardy to strike any stroke more after
the proclamation of the cry; and so ceased the said battle, <i>Deo
gratias</i>.</p>

<p>Formerly, when there were many good and mature rectors
of churches resident there, the quarrels and dissensions which
arose within a parish or between parishioners, were generally
settled by the good handling and advice of such rectors, and
there were few pleas and actions through lawyers.... But
now, by the lack of such good rectors, strifes, quarrels, dissensions,
actions and pleas are multiplied and prolonged, and thus
the money, which might have gone to good works, owing to
the number of the quarrels goes to the lawyers, advocates, and

men say five hundred horse of them. Moreover, on Trinity
Sunday in the morning, came tidings unto my Lord of

and then my Lord went and manned five ships of forecastle,
and three carvels, and four pinnaces, and on the Monday,

afore Calais at four at the clock in the morning, and fought

like to fight together again in haste.</p>

<p><i>Unworthy promotions</i> [pp. 13, 14].</p>

<p>It is notorious now in the realm of England that boys,
youths and men dwelling in the courts of the worldly are
placed in churches, in high offices and in prelacies, others
being set aside who have long been occupied in study and
preaching and in the guiding of the people without thought of
worldly lucre.... Among others unworthily promoted, one
foolish youth, eighteen years of age, was promoted to twelve
prebends and a great archdeaconry of the value of a hundred
pounds, and to one great rectory, and a certain layman
received the rents of all the said benefices, and spent upon the
youth just as much as he, the layman, pleased, and never
rendered an account, and that youth was the son of a simple
knight, and, like an idiot, was drunk almost every day.</p>

<p><i>Non-residence</i> [pp. 3, 149].</p>

<p>Some never or seldom reside in their cures, and he to whom
a church is appropriated and who is non-resident, comes once
a year to his cure, or sends to the church at the end of the
autumn, and having filled his purse with money and sold his
tithes, departs again far away from his cure to the court where
he occupies himself in money-making and pleasures.... O
Lord God! incline the heart of the Pope, Thy vicar, to
remedy the evils which arise through the appropriation of
churches, and by the non-residence of good curates in the
same. For now in England a time draweth nigh when men
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_74" title="74">74</a>will say, "Formerly there were rectors in England, and now
there are ruined churches in which cultured men cannot
decently live...."</p>

<p><i>Church dues oppressive</i> [p. 13].</p>

<p>For Rome, like a singular and principal wild beast, hath
laid waste the vineyards of the church, reserving to herself the
elections of bishops, that none may confer an episcopal church
on anyone unless they first pay the annates or first-fruits and
rent of the vacant church. Also she hath destroyed the vineyard
of God's church in many places, by annulling the elections
of all the bishops in England. Also she destroys the
church by promoting wicked men according as the King and
the Pope agree.</p>

<p><i>The abuse of the Sacraments</i> [pp. 197].</p>

<p>It is now known that many infants die without baptism
because the parish churches have no fonts, and divers abbeys
have licence and custom that everyone of certain parishes
should baptise in their monasteries, and yet they cannot come
conveniently by night, or at other times to the font there.</p>

<p><i>Proud Prelates</i> [pp. 22, 23].</p>

<p>Bishops were wont, as is manifest in the Life of St. Cuthbert,
to talk humbly and familiarly with their inferiors and
every day to give everyone of their flock an audience if he
sought to speak with his bishop. Recently a poor man came
to the servant of a certain archbishop, the son of a lord, and said
"I marvel that the archbishop does not give audience in his
own person to his flock as his predecessor was wont to do."
The servant replied "My lord the present archbishop was not
bred in the same way as his predecessor" (meaning by this
that his lord the archbishop, who was so strange and distant
to his flock, was the son of a lord, and his predecessor was the
son of a poor man); the poor man answered the said servant,
"Truly the present archbishop and his predecessor were bred
in different fashions, but it is manifest that the predecessor was
the better man and more useful to his flock and to their souls
and to the whole diocese."</p>

<p>In this same time the realm of England was out of all good
governance, as it had been many days before, for the King was
simple and led by covetous counsel, and owed more than he
was worth. His debts increased daily, but payment there was
none; all the possessions and lordships that pertained to the
Crown the King had given away, some to lords and some to
other simple persons, so that he had almost nought to live on.
And such impositions as were put to the people, as taxes,
tallages and quinzimes (fifteenths), all that came from them
were spent in vain, for he held no household nor maintained
no wars. For these misgovernances, and for many other, the
hearts of the people were turned away from them that had the
land in governance, and their blessing was turned into cursing.
The queen with such as were of her affinity ruled the realm as
they liked, gathering riches innumerable. The officers of the
realm, and especially the earl of Wiltshire, treasurer of England,
for to enrich himself, peeled the poor people and disinherited
rightful heirs and did many wrongs. The queen was
defamed and slandered, that he that was called Prince was not
her son.... Wherefore she, dreading that he should not
succeed his father in the crown of England, allied unto her all
the knights and squires of Cheshire, for to have their benevolence,
and held open household among them ... trusting
through them to make her son King.</p>

<p>The King at Northampton lay at Friars, and had ordained
there a strong and mighty field in the meadows, armed and
arrayed with guns, having the river at his back. The earls
[March and Warwick] with the number of sixty thousand, as
it was said, came to Northampton and sent certain bishops to
the King beseeching him that, in eschewing of effusion of
Christian blood, he would admit and suffer the earls for to
come into his presence to declare themselves as they were.
The duke of Buckingham that stood beside the King, said unto
them, "Ye come not as bishops for to treat for peace, but as
men of arms;" because they brought with them a notable
company of men of arms. They answered and said, "We
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_77" title="77">77</a>come thus for surety of our persons, for they that be about the
King be not our friends."</p>

<p>"Forsooth!" said the duke, "the Earl of Warwick shall not
come to the King's presence, and if he come he shall die."
The messengers returned again and told this to the earls....</p>

<p>Then on the Thursday the x<sup>th</sup> day of July, the year of our
Lord 1460, at two hours after noon, the said earls of March
and Warwick let cry through the field, that no man should lay
hands upon the King nor on the common people, but only on
the lords, knights, and squires: then the trumpets blew up,
and both hosts encountered and fought together half an hour,...
The duke of Buckingham, the earl of Shrewsbury, the
lord Beaumont, the lord Egremont were slain by the Kentishmen
besides the King's tent, and many other knights and
squires. The ordinance of the King's guns availed not, for
that day was so great rain that the guns lay deep in water, and
so were quenched and might not be shot. When the field was
done, and the earls through mercy and help had the victory,
they came to the King in his tent, and said in this wise:
"Most noble Prince, displease you not, though it hath pleased
God of his Grace to grant us the victory of our mortal enemies,
the which by their venomous malice have untruly steered and
moved your highness to exile us out of your land. We come
not to that intent for to inquiet nor grieve your said highness,
but for to please your most noble person, desiring most
tenderly the high welfare and prosperity thereof, and of all
your realm, and for to be your true liegemen while our lives
shall endure." The King of their words was greatly recomforted,
and anon was led into Northampton with procession,
where he rested him three days, and then came to London, the
xvj day of the month abovesaid, and lodged in the bishop's
palace. For the which victory London gave to Almighty God
great laud and thanking.</p>

her so in doubt of her life and son's life also. And then she
come to the castle of Hardelowe [Harlech] in Wales, and she
had many great gifts and [was] greatly comforted, for she had
need thereof. And most commonly she rode behind a young
poor gentleman of fourteen year age, his name was John
Combe, born at Amysbery in Wiltshire. And there hence she
removed full privily unto the Lord Jasper, Lord and Earl of
Pembroke, for she durst not abide in no place that was open,
but in private. The cause was that counterfeit tokens were
sent unto her as though they had come from her most dread
lord the King Harry the VI.; but it was not of his sending,
neither of his doing, but forged thing;... for at the King's
departing from Coventry toward the field of Northampton, he
kissed her and blessed the prince, and commanded her that she
should not come unto him till that he send a special token
unto her that no man knew but the King and she. For the
lords would fain had her unto London, for they knew well that
all the workings that were done grew by her, for she was more
wittier than the King, and that appeareth by his deeds.</p>

<p class="subheading"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Hall's <i>Chronicle</i>, pp. 250, 251. (London: 1809.)</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Hall's <i>Chronicle</i> was first published in 1542, and therefore the
following extract is by no means contemporary with the events it describes.
But it is the only account of the battle of Wakefield, and it derives some
authority from the fact that Hall had an ancestor who was slain in the fight.]</p>


<p>The duke of York with his people descended down the hill
in good order and array and was suffered to pass forward,
toward the main battle: but when he was in the plain ground
between his castle and the town of Wakefield, he was environed
on every side, like a fish in a net or a deer in a
buckstall: so that he, manfully fighting, was within half an
hour slain and dead, and his whole army discomfited....
While this battle was in fighting a priest called Sir Robert
Aspall, chaplain and schoolmaster to the young earl of Rutland,
second son to the abovenamed duke of York, of the age of
twelve years, a fair gentleman and a maidenlike person, perceiving
that flight was more safeguard than tarrying, both for
him and his master, secretly conveyed the earl out of the field
... but or he could enter into a house the lord Clifford
espied, followed and taken, and by reason of his apparell
demanded what he was. The young gentleman, dismayed, had
not a word to speak, but kneeled on his knees imploring mercy
and desiring grace both with holding up his hands and making
dolorous countenance, for his speech was gone for fear. "Save
him," said the Chaplain, "for he is a prince's son, and peradventure
may do you good hereafter." With that word the
Lord Clifford marked him and said, "By God's blood, thy
father slew mine, and so will I do thee and all thy kin," and
with that word stuck the earl to the heart with his dagger, and
bade the chaplain bear the earl's mother and brother word
what he had done.... This cruel Clifford and deadly blood-supper,
not content with this homicide or child-killing, came to
the place where the dead corpse of the duke of York lay, and
caused his head to be stricken off, and set on it a crown of
paper and so fixed it on a pole and presented it to the Queen,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_80" title="80">80</a>not lying far from the field, in great despite and much derision,
saying, "Madame, your war is done; here is your King's
ransom."</p>

<p>The duke being thus removed from this world, the north-men,
being sensible that the only impediment was now
withdrawn, and that there was no one now who could care to
resist their inroads, again swept onwards like a whirlwind
from the north, and in the impulse of their fury attempted to
overrun the whole of England. At this period too, fancying
that everything tended to insure them freedom from molestation,
paupers and beggars flocked forth from those quarters in
infinite numbers, just like so many mice rushing forth from
their holes, and universally devoted themselves to spoil and
rapine, without regard of place or person. For, besides the
vast quantities of property which they collected outside, they
also irreverently rushed, in their unbridled and frantic rage,
into churches and the other sanctuaries of God, and most
nefariously plundered them of their chalices, books, and vestments,
and, unutterable crime! broke open the pixes in which
were kept the body of Christ, and shook out the sacred
elements therefrom. When the priests and the other faithful
of Christ in any way offered to make resistance, like so many
abandoned wretches as they were, they cruelly slaughtered
them in the very churches or church yards. Thus did they
proceed with impunity, spreading in vast multitudes over a
space of thirty miles in breadth, and, covering the whole
surface of the earth just like so many locusts, made their way
almost to the very walls of London; all the moveables which
they could possibly collect in every quarter being placed on
beasts of burden and carried off. With such avidity for spoil
did they press on, that they dug up the precious vessels,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_81" title="81">81</a>which, through fear of them, had been concealed in the earth,
and with threats of death compelled the people to produce the
treasures which they had hidden in remote and obscure spots.</p>

<p>Also Edward Earl of March, the Duke of York's son and
heir, had a great journey at Mortimer's Cross in Wales the
second day of February next so following, and there he put to
flight the Earl of Pembroke,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> (and) the Earl of Wiltshire.
And there he took and slew of knights and squires to the
number of 3,000.</p>

<p>And in that journey was Owen Tudor taken and brought
unto Hereford, and he was beheaded at the market place, and
his head set upon the highest grice<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> of the market cross, and
a mad woman combed his hair and washed away the blood of
his face, and she got candles and set them about him, burning
more than a hundred. This Owen Tudor was father unto the
Earl of Pembroke, and had wedded Queen Catherine, King
Harry the VI.'s mother, thinking and trusting all the way that
he should not be beheaded until he saw the axe and the block,
and when that he was in his doublet he trusted on pardon and
grace till the collar of his red velvet doublet was ripped off.
Then he said: "That head shall lie on the stock that was
wont to lie on Queen Catherine's lap," and put his heart and
mind wholly unto God, and full meekly to his death.</p>

<p>Edward pursued them as far as a level spot of ground,
situate near the castle of Pomfret and the bridge at Ferry<a class="pagenum" name="Page_82" title="82">82</a>bridge,
and washed by a stream of considerable size; where
he found an army drawn up in order of battle, composed of
the remnants of the northern troops of King Henry. They,
accordingly, engaged in a most severe conflict, and fighting
hand to hand with sword and spear, there was no small
slaughter on either side. However, by the mercy of the
Divine clemency, King Edward soon experienced the favour
of heaven, and, gaining the wished-for victory over his
enemies, compelled them either to submit to be slain or to
take to flight. For, their ranks being now broken and scattered
in flight, the King's army eagerly pursued them, and
cutting down the fugitives with their swords, just like so
many sheep for the slaughter, made immense havoc among
them for a distance of ten miles, as far as the city of York.
Prince Edward, however, with a part of his men, as conqueror,
remained upon the field of battle, and awaited the rest of his
army, which had gone in various directions in pursuit of the
enemy.</p>

<p>When the solemnities of the Lord's day, which is known as
Palm Sunday, were now close at hand, after distributing
rewards among such as brought the bodies of the slain, and
gave them burial, the King hastened to enter the before-named
city. Those who helped to inter the bodies, piled up in pits
and in trenches prepared for the purpose, bear witness that
eight-and-thirty thousand warriors fell on that day, besides
those who were drowned in the river before alluded to, whose
numbers we have no means of ascertaining. The blood, too,
of the slain, mingling with the snow, which at this time covered
the whole surface of the earth, afterwards ran down in the
furrows and ditches along with the melted snow, in a most
shocking manner, for a distance of two or three miles.</p>

<p>This year, about Midsummer, at the royal feast of the
Sergeants of the Coif, the Mayor of London was desired to be
at that feast. And at dinner time he came to the feast with
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_84" title="84">84</a>his officers, agreeing and according unto his degree. For
within London he is next unto the King in all manner [of]
thing. And in time of washing the Earl of Worcester was
taken before the mayor and set down in the midst of the high
table. And the mayor seeing that his place was occupied held
him content, and went home again without meat or drink or
anything, but reward him he did as his dignity required of the
city. And took with him the substance of his brethren the
aldermen to his place, and were set and served as soon as any
man could devise, both of cygnet and of other delicacies
enough, that all the house marvelled how well everything was
done in so short a time....</p>

<p>Then the officers of the feast, full evil ashamed, informed the
masters of the feast of this mishap that is befallen. And they,
considering the great dignity and costs and charge that belonged
to the city, anon sent unto the mayor a present of meat,
bread and wine and many divers subtleties. But when they
that come with the presents saw all the gifts and the service
that was at the board, he was full sore ashamed that should do
the message, for the present was not better than the service of
meat was before the mayor and throughout the high table.
But his demeaning was so that he had love and thanks for his
message and a great reward withal. And thus the worship of
the city was kept and not lost for him. And I trust that never
it shall, by the grace of God.</p>

<p>Now take heed what love may do, for love will not nor may
not cast no fault nor peril in nothing.</p>

<p>That same year, the first day of May, our sovereign lord the
King Edward IV. was wedded to the Lord Rivers' daughter;
her name is Dame Elizabeth that was wife unto Sir John
Grey.... And this marriage was kept full secretly long and
many a day, that no man knew it; but men marvelled that our
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_85" title="85">85</a>sovereign lord was so long without any wife, and were ever
feared that he had been not chaste of his living. But on All
Hallows' day at Reading there it was known, for there the
King kept his common council, and the lords moved him and
exhorted him in God's name to be wedded and to live under the
law of God and Church, and (that) they would send into some
strong land to inquire a queen of good birth according to his
dignity. And then our sovereign might no longer hide his
marriage, and told them how he had done, and made that the
marriage should be opened unto his lords.</p>

<p>I greet you well, letting you wit that your brother and his
fellowship stand in great jeopardy at Caister, and lack victuals;
and Dawbeney and Berney be dead, and divers others greatly
hurt; and they fail gunpowder and arrows, and the place sore
broken with guns of the other party, so that, but they have
hasty help, they be like to lose both their lives and the place,
to the greatest rebuke to you that ever came to any gentleman,
for every man in this country marvelleth greatly that ye
suffer them to be so long in so great jeopardy without help or
other remedy.</p>

<p>The Duke hath been more fervently set there upon, and more
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_87" title="87">87</a>cruel, since that Wretyll, my Lord of Clarence's man, was
there, than he was before, and he hath sent for all his tenants
from every place, and others, to be there at Caister at Thursday
next coming, that there is then like to be the greatest multitude
of people that came there yet. And they purpose them
to make a great assault&mdash;for they have sent for guns to Lynn
and other place by the seaside&mdash;that, with their great multitude
of guns, with other shoot and ordnance, there shall no
man dare appear in the place. They shall hold them so busy
with their great people, that it shall not lie in their power
within to hold it against them, without God help them, or have
hasty succour from you.</p>

<p>Therefore, as ye will have my blessing, I charge you and
require you that ye see your brother be helped in haste. And
if he can have no means, rather desire writing from my Lord
of Clarence, if he be at London, or else of my Lord Archbishop
of York, to the Duke of Norfolk, that he will grant
them that be in the place their lives and their goods; and in
eschewing of insurrections with other inconveniences that be
like to grow within the shire of Norfolk, this troublous world,
because of such conventicles and gatherings within the said
shire for cause of the said place, they shall suffer him to
enter upon such appointment, or other like taking by the
advise of your council there at London, if ye think this be not
good, till the law hath determined otherwise; and let him
write another letter to your brother to deliver the place upon
the same appointment....</p>

<p>Do your devoir now, and let me send you no more
messengers for this matter; but send me by the bearer here
of more certain comfort than ye have done by all other that
I have sent before. In any wise, let the letters that shall
come to the Earl of Oxenford come with the letters that shall
come to the Duke of Norfolk, that if he will not agree to the
tone, that ye may have ready your rescue that it need no
more to send therefore. God keep you.</p>

<p>Here is to know, that in the beginning of the month of
October in the year of our Lord 1470, the bishop of Winchester,
by the assent of the Duke of Clarence and the Earl
of Warwick, went to the Tower of London, where King
Harry was in prison, (by King Edward's commandment,)
which was not worshipfully arrayed as a prince, and not so
cleanly kept as should beseem such a prince. They had him
out and new arrayed him, and did to him great reverence, and
brought him to the palace of Westminster, and so he was
restored again to the Crown.... Whereof all his good lovers
were full glad, and the more part of people also.... [For]
when King Edward the Fourth reigned the people looked
after ... prosperities and peace, but it came not; but one
battle after another, and much trouble and great loss of goods
among the common people; as first the fifteenth of all their
goods, and then a whole fifteenth, and yet at every battle
[they had] to come far out of their countries at their own
cost; and these and such other causes brought England right
low, and many men said King Edward had much blame for
hurting merchandize, for in his days they were not in other
lands, nor within England, taken in such reputation and
credence as they were before.</p>

<p>The same night following upon the morn, Wednesday and
Thursday, the 14th day of March fell great storms, winds and
tempests upon the sea, so that the said 14th day, in great
torment, he came to Humber Head, where the other ships
were dissevered from him, and every from other, so that of
necessity they were driven to land, every one far from the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_89" title="89">89</a>other. The King, with his ship alone, wherein was the Lord
Hastings, his Chamberlain, and others to the number of five
hundred well chosen men, landed within Humber on Holderness
side at a place called Ravenspurne. The King's brother,
Richard Duke of Gloucester, and in his company three
hundred men landed at another place, four miles from thence.
The Earl Rivers, and the fellowship being in his company, to
the number of two hundred, landed at a place called Powle,
fourteen miles from whence the King landed, and the remainder
of the fellowship where they might best get land. That night
the King was lodged at a poor village two miles from his
landing, with a few with him; but that night, and in the
morning, the residue that were coming in his ship, the rage
of the tempest somewhat appeased, landed, and alway drew
towards the King.</p>

<p>... The King at that time being at Warwick, and understanding
his near approaching, upon an afternoon issued out of
Warwick, with all his fellowship, by the space of three miles,
into a fair field towards Banbury, where he saw the Duke [of
Clarence], his brother, in fair array come towards him, with a
great fellowship. And when they were together within less
than half a mile, the King set his people in array, the banners
displayed, and left them standing still, taking with him his
brother of Gloucester, the Lord Rivers, Lord Hastings, and a
few others, and went towards his brother of Clarence. And
in like wise the Duke for his part, taking with him a few noblemen,
and leaving his host in good order, departed from them
towards the King. And so they met betwixt both hosts, where
there was right kind and loving language betwixt them two,
with perfect accord knit together for ever hereafter, with as
heartily loving cheer and countenance as might be betwixt
two brethren of so great nobility and estate.</p>

<p>On the morrow, betimes, the King, understanding that the
day approached near, betwixt four and five of the clock,
notwithstanding there was a great mist, and hindered the sight
of each other, yet he committed his cause and quarrel to
Almighty God, advanced his banners, did blow on trumpets,
and set upon them, first with shot, and then, and soon, they
joined and came to hand-strokes, wherein his enemies manly
and courageously received them, as well in shot as in hand-strokes,
when they joined; which joining of their both battles
(armies) was not directly front to front, as they so should have
joined, had it not been for the mist, which suffered neither
party to see the other, but for a little space; and that of
likelihood caused the battle to be the more cruel and mortal;
for so it was that the one end of their battle overreached the
end of the King's battle, and so at that end they were much
mightier than was the King's battle at the same end, that
joined with them, which was the west end, and therefore, upon
that part of the King's battle they had a greater distress upon
the King's party; wherefore many fled towards Barnet, and
so forth to London, ere ever they left off; and they (the
Earl's party) fell into the chase of them and did much harm.
But the other parties, and the residue of neither battle, might
see that distress, neither the fleeing, nor the chase, because of
the great mist that was, which would not suffer any man to see
but a little from him; and so the King's battle, which saw
none of all that, was thereby in nothing discouraged, for, save
only a few that were near unto them, no man wist thereof;
also the other party by the same distress, flight, or chase, were
therefore the greater encouraged. And in likewise at the east
end, the King's battle, when they came to joining, overreached
their battle, and so distressed them there greatly, and so drew
near towards the King, who was about the midst of the battle,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_91" title="91">91</a>and sustained all the might and weight thereof. Nevertheless
upon the same little distress at the west end, anon ran the
news to Westminster, and to London, and so further to other
countries, that the King was distressed, and his field lost; but
the laud be to Almighty God! it was otherwise; for the King,
trusting verily in God's help, our blessed Lady's and Saint
George, took to him great hardiness and courage, for to
suppress the falsehood of all them that so falsely and so
traitorously had conspired against him, wherethrough, with
the faithful, well-beloved, and mighty assistance of his fellowship,
that in great number dissevered not from his person, and
were as well assured unto him as to them was possible, he
manly, vigorously, and valiantly, assailed them in the midst
and strongest of their battle, where he, with great violence,
beat and bare down before him all that stood in his way, and
then turned to the range, first on that hand, and then on that
other hand, in length, and so beat and bare them down, so that
nothing might stand in the sight of him, and the well assured
fellowship that attended truly upon him; so that, blessed be
God! he won the field there, and the perfect victory remained
unto him, and to his rebels the discomfiture of thirty thousand
men, as they numbered themselves. In this battle was slain
the Earl of Warwick....</p>

<p>On the morrow after, the King commanded that the bodies
of the dead lords, the Earl of Warwick, and his brother, the
Marquis, should be brought to St. Paul's in London, and, in
the church there, openly shewed to all the people; to the
intent that after that the people should not be abused by
feigned seditious tales, which many of them, that were wont to
be towards the Earl of Warwick, had been accustomed to
make; and, peradventure, so would have made after that, had
not the dead bodies there been shewed, open and naked and
well known; for, doubtless, else the rumour should have been
sown about in all countries that they both, or else at the
least, the Earl of Warwick was yet alive, upon the cursed
intent thereby to have caused new murmurs, insurrections
and rebellions amongst indisposed people.</p>

<p>And the same night that King Edward came to London,
King Harry, being in ward, in prison in the Tower of London,
was put to death, the twenty-first day of May, on a Tuesday
night, betwixt eleven and twelve of the clock; being then at
the Tower the Duke of Gloucester, brother to King Edward,
and many others; and on the morrow he was coffined and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_93" title="93">93</a>brought to St. Paul's, and his face was open that every man
might see him. And in his lying, he bled on the pavement
there; and afterward at the Black Friars was brought, and
there he bled anew and afresh; and from thence he was
carried to Chertsey Abbey in a boat, and buried there in our
Lady Chapel.</p>

<p>Here it is to be remembered, that from the time of Tewkesbury-field,
where Edward, called Prince, was slain, then, and
soon after, were taken and slain at the King's will, all the
noblemen that came from beyond the sea with the said
Edward, called Prince, and others also their partakers as
many as were of any might or puissance. Queen Margaret
herself was taken and brought to the King, and in every part
of England, where any commotion was begun for King Henry's
party, anon they were rebuked, so that it appeared to every
man at once, the said party was extinct and repressed for
ever, without any manner of hope of again quickening; utterly
deprived of any manner of hope or relief. The certainty of all
which came to the knowledge of the said Henry, late called
King, being in the Tower of London. Not having before that
knowledge of the said matters, he took it to so great despite,
ire, and indignation, that of pure displeasure and melancholy,
he died the twenty-third day of the month of May. Whom
the King did order to be brought to the friars preachers at
London, and there his funeral service done, to be carried by
water to an Abbey upon Thames' Side, sixteen miles from
London, called Chertsey, and there honourably interred.</p>

<p><i>The coming into England of the Lord Gruthuyse from the right
high and mighty Prince Charles duke of Burgundy.</i></p>

<p>When he [Gruthuyse] came to the castle of Windsor, into
the quadrant, my lord Hastings, chamberlain to the King, Sir
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_94" title="94">94</a>John Parr, Sir John Don with divers other lords and nobles
received him to the King. The King had caused to be imparrailled
on the far side of the quadrant three chambers richly
hanged with cloths of Arras and with beds of state, and when
he had spoken with the King's grace and the queen, he was
accompanied to his chamber by the lord chamberlain and Sir
John Parr with divers more, which supped with him in his
chamber; also there supped with him his servants. When
they had supped, my lord chamberlain had him again to the
King's chamber. There incontinent the King had him to the
queen's chamber where she had there her ladies playing at
morteaulx,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and some of her ladies and gentlemen at the
closheys<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> of ivory, and dancing. And some at divers other
games accordingly. The which sight was full pleasant to
them. Also the King danced with my lady Elizabeth, his
eldest daughter. That done, the night passed over, they went
to his chamber. The lord Gruthuyse took leave, and my lord
chamberlain with divers nobles accompanied him to his
chamber, where they departed for that night. And in the
morning when Matins was done, the King heard in his own
chapel our Lady's mass, which was melodiously sung, the lord
Gruthuyse being there present. When the mass was done, the
King gave the said lord Gruthuyse a cup of gold garnished
with pearl. In the midst of the cup is a great piece of unicorn's
horn,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> to my estimation, seven inches compass. And in
the cover was a great sapphire. Then went he to his chamber
where he had his breakfast. And when he had broken his
fast, the King came to the quadrant. My lord prince also,
borne by his chamberlain called Master Vaughan, which bade
the aforesaid lord Gruthuyse welcome. Then the King had
him and all his company into the little Park, where he made
him to have great sport. And there the King made him ride
on his own horse, a right fair hobby, the which the King gave
him.... The King's dinner was ordained in the lodge, and
before dinner they killed no game save a doe; the which the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_95" title="95">95</a>King gave to the servants of the lord Gruthuyse. And when
the King had dined, they went a-hunting again. And by the
castle were found certain deer lying; some with greyhounds
and some run to death with buck-hounds.... By that time it
was near night, yet the King shewed him his garden and Vineyard
of Pleasure, and so turned into the castle again where
they heard evensong in their chambers.</p>

<p>The queen ordained a great banquet in her own chamber.
At which banquet were the King, the queen, my lady Elizabeth
the King's eldest daughter, the lord Gruthuyse (etc)....
There was a side table at which sat a great view of ladies, all
on the one side. Also in the outer chamber sat the queen's
gentlewomen, all on one side. And on the other side of the
table over against them, as many of the lord Gruthuyse's
servants, as touching to the abundant welfare like as it is
according to such a banquet. And when they had supped, my
lady Elizabeth danced with the Duke of Buckingham and
divers other ladies also. Then about nine of the clock the
King and the queen, with all her ladies, brought the said lord
Gruthuyse to three chambers of Pleasance, all hanged with
white silk and linen cloth, and all the floors covered with
carpets. There was ordained a bed for himself, of as good
down as could be gotten, the sheets of Rennes, also fine
fustians; the counterpoint cloth of gold, furred with ermine,
the tester and celer also shining cloth of gold, the curtains of
white sarcent; as for his head suit and pillows, they were of the
queen's own ordering. The second chamber was another of
state, the which was all white. Also in the same chamber was
made a couch with feather beds, hanged with a tent knit like a
net, and there was a cupboard. In the third chamber was a
bath or two, which were covered with tents of white cloth.
And when the King and the queen, with all her ladies, had
showed him these chambers, they turned again to their own
chambers, and left the said lord Gruthuyse there, accompanied
with my lord chamberlain, which disrobed him, and went both
to the bath.... And when they had been in their baths as
long as was their pleasure they had green ginger, confits and
ypocras, and then they went to bed.</p>

<p>Now each began to look upon the other with no very fraternal
eyes. You might then have seen (as such men are generally
to be found in the courts of all princes) flatterers running
to and fro, from the one side to the other, and carrying
backwards and forwards the words which had fallen from the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_98" title="98">98</a>two brothers, even if they had happened to be spoken in the
most secret closet. The arrest of the duke for the purpose of
compelling him to answer the charges brought against him
happened under the following circumstances. One Master
John Stacy, a person who was called an astronomer, when in
reality he was rather a great sorcerer, formed a plot in conjunction
with one Burdet, an esquire, and one of the said
duke's household; upon which he was accused, among
numerous other charges, of having made leaden images and
other things to procure thereby the death of Richard, Lord
Beauchamp, at the request of his adulterous wife. Upon
being questioned in a very severe examination as to his practice
of damnable arts of this nature, he made confession of many
matters, which told both against himself and the said Thomas
Burdet. The consequence was, that Thomas was arrested as
well; and at last, judgment of death was pronounced upon
them both, at Westminster, from the Bench of our lord the
king, the judges being there seated, together with nearly all the
lords temporal of the kingdom. Being drawn to the gallows at
Tyburn, they were permitted briefly to say what they thought
fit before being put to death; upon which, they protested
their innocence, Stacy indeed but faintly; while, on the other
hand, Burdet spoke at great length, and with much spirit, and
as his last words exclaimed with Susanna, "Behold! I must
die; whereas I never did such things as these."</p>

<p>On the following day, the Duke of Clarence came to the
council-chamber at Westminster, bringing with him a famous
Doctor of the Order of Minorites, Master William Goddard by
name, in order that he might read the confession and declaration
of innocence above-mentioned before the lords in the said
council assembled; which he accordingly did, and then withdrew.
The king was then at Windsor, but when he was
informed of this circumstance, he was greatly displeased
thereat, and recalling to mind the information formerly laid
against his brother, and which he had long kept treasured up
in his breast, he summoned the duke to appear on a certain day
in the royal palace of Westminster: upon which, in presence
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_99" title="99">99</a>of the Mayor and aldermen of the city of London, the king
began, with his own lips, amongst other matters, to inveigh
against the conduct of the before-named duke, as being derogatory
to the laws of the realm, and most dangerous to judges
and jurors throughout the kingdom. But why enlarge? The
duke was placed in custody, and from that day up to the time
of his death never was known to have regained his liberty.</p>

<p>The circumstances that happened in the ensuing Parliament
my mind shudders to enlarge upon, for then was to be witnessed
a sad strife carried on before these two brethren of such
high estate. For not a single person uttered a word against
the duke except the King; not one individual made answer
to the King except the duke. Some parties were introduced,
however, as to whom it was greatly doubted by many, whether
they filled the office of accusers rather, or of witnesses; these
two offices not being exactly suited to the same person in the
same cause. The duke met all the charges made against him
with a denial, and offered, if he could only obtain a hearing, to
defend his cause with his own hand. But why delay in using
many words? Parliament being of opinion that the informations
which they had heard were established, passed sentence
upon him of condemnation, the same being pronounced by the
mouth of Henry, duke of Buckingham, who was appointed
Seneschal of England for the occasion. After this, execution
was delayed for a considerable time; until the Speaker of the
Commons, coming to the upper house with his fellows, made
a fresh request that the matter might be brought to a conclusion.
In consequence of this, in a few days after, the
execution, whatever its nature may have been, took place (and
would that it had ended these troubles!) in the Tower of
London, it being the year of our Lord, 1478, and the eighteenth
of the reign of King Edward.</p>

<p><i>William Paston Junior to John Paston.</i></p>

<p>Right reverend and worshipful brother, after all duties of
recommendation, I recommend me to you, desiring to hear of
your prosperity and welfare, which I pray God long to continue
to His pleasure, and to your heart's desire; letting you
wit that I received a letter from you, in the which letter was
eight pence with the which I should buy a pair of slippers.</p>

<p>Furthermore certifying you, as for the 13s. 4d. which ye
sent by a gentleman's man, for my board, called Thomas
Newton, was delivered to mine hostess, and so to my creditor,
Mr. Thomas Stevenson; and he heartily recommended him to
you.</p>

<p>Also ye send me word in the letter of 12 lbs. figs and 8 lbs.
raisins. I have them not delivered, but I doubt I shall have,
for Alwedyr told me of them, and he said that they came after
in another barge.</p>

<p>And as for the young gentlewoman, I will certify you how I
first fell in acquaintance with her. Her father is dead; there
be two sisters of them; the elder is just wedded; at the which
wedding I was with mine hostess, and also desired by the
gentleman himself, called William Swanne, whose dwelling is
in Eton.</p>

<p>So it fortuned that mine hostess reported on me otherwise
than I was worthy; so that her mother commanded her to
make me good cheer, and so in good faith she did. She is not
abiding where she is now; her dwelling is in London; but her
mother and she come to a place of hers five miles from Eton,
where the wedding was, for because it was nigh to the gentleman
which wedded her daughter. And on Monday next coming,
that is to say, the first Monday of Clean Lent, her mother and
she will go to the pardon at Sheen, and so forth to London,
and there to abide in a place of hers in Bow Church Yard;
and if it please you to inquire of her, her mother's name is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_101" title="101">101</a>Mistress Alborow; the name of the daughter is Margaret
Alborow; the age of her is by all likelihood eighteen or nineteen
year at the furthest. And as for the money and plate, it
is ready whensoever she were wedded; but as for the livelihood,
I trow not till after her mother's decease; but I cannot tell you
for very certain, but you may know by inquiring. And as for
her beauty, judge you that when ye see her, if so be that ye
take the labour, and specially behold her hands; for and if it
be as it is told me, she is disposed to be plump.</p>

<p>And as for my coming from Eton, I lack nothing but versifying,
which I trust to have with a little continuance.</p>

THRONE (1483).</h2></div>

<p>The body of the deceased King [Edward IV.] being accordingly
interred with all honour in due ecclesiastical form, in the
new collegiate Chapel of Windsor, which he had erected of the
most elaborate workmanship from the foundations; all were
most anxiously awaiting the day of the new King's coronation,
which was to be the first Lord's day in the month of May,
which fell this year on the fourth day of the said month. In
the meantime the duke of Gloucester wrote the most soothing
letters in order to console the queen, with promises that he
would shortly arrive, and assurances of all duty, fealty, and
due obedience to his King and lord Edward the Fifth, the
eldest son of the deceased King, his brother, and of the queen.
Accordingly, on his arrival at York with a becoming retinue,
each person being arrayed in mourning, he performed a solemn
funeral service for the King, the same being accompanied
with plenteous tears. Constraining all the nobility of those
parts to take the oath of fealty to the late King's son, he himself
was the first of all to take the oath. On reaching Northampton,
where the duke of Buckingham joined him, there
came thither for the purpose of paying their respects to him,
Antony, earl of Rivers, the King's uncle, and Richard Grey, a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_103" title="103">103</a>most noble knight, and uterine brother to the King, together
with several others who had been sent by the King, his
nephew, to submit the conduct of everything to the will and
discretion of his uncle, the duke of Gloucester. On their first
arrival, they were received with an especially cheerful and
joyous countenance, and, sitting at supper at the duke's table,
passed the whole time in very pleasant conversation. At last,
Henry, duke of Buckingham, also arrived there, and, as it
was now late, they all retired to their respective lodgings.</p>

<p>When the morning, and as it afterwards turned out, a most
disastrous one, had come, having taken counsel during the
night, all the Lords took their departure together, in order to
present themselves before the new King at Stony Stratford, a
town a few miles distant from Northampton; and now, lo and
behold! when the two dukes had nearly arrived at the entrance
of that town, they arrested the said earl of Rivers, and his
nephew Richard, the King's brother, together with some
others who had come with them, and commanded them to be
led prisoners into the north of England. Immediately after,
this circumstance being not yet known in the neighbouring
town where the King was understood to be, they suddenly
rushed into the place where the youthful King was staying,
and in like manner made prisoners of certain others of his
servants who were in attendance on his person. One of these
was Thomas Vaughan, an aged knight and chamberlain of the
prince before-named.</p>

<p>The duke of Gloucester, however, who was the ringleader in
this outbreak, did not omit or refuse to pay every mark of
respect to the King, his nephew, in the way of uncovering the
head, bending the knee, or other posture of the body required
in a subject. He asserted that his only care was for the protection
of his own person, as he knew for certain that there
were men in attendance upon the King who had conspired
against both his own honour and his very existence. Thus
saying, he caused proclamation to be made, that all the King's
attendants should instantly withdraw from the town, and not
approach any place to which the King might chance to come,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_104" title="104">104</a>under penalty of death. These events took place at Stony
Stratford on Wednesday, on the last day of April, in the year
above-mentioned, being the same in which his father died.</p>

<p>These reports having reached London on the following
night, queen Elizabeth betook herself, with all her children,
to the sanctuary at Westminster. In the morning you might
have seen there the adherents of both parties, some sincerely,
others treacherously, on account of the uncertainty of events,
siding with the one party or the other. For some collected
their forces at Westminster in the queen's name, others at
London under the shadow of the lord Hastings, and took up
their position there....</p>

<p>... On the Monday following, they came with a great multitude
by water to Westminster, armed with swords and staves,
and compelled the cardinal lord archbishop of Canterbury,
with many others, to enter the sanctuary, in order to appeal to
the good feelings of the queen and prompt her to allow her
son Richard, duke of York, to come forth and proceed to the
Tower, that he might comfort the King his brother. In
words, assenting with many thanks to this proposal, she
accordingly sent the boy, who was conducted by the lord
cardinal to the King in the said Tower of London.</p>

<p>From this day, these dukes acted no longer in secret, but
openly manifested their intentions. For, having summoned
armed men, in fearful and unheard-of numbers, from the north,
Wales, and all other parts then subject to them, the said Protector
Richard assumed the government of the kingdom, with
the title of King, on the twentieth day of the aforesaid month
of June; and on the same day, at the great Hall at Westminster,
obtruded himself into the marble chair. The colour
for this act of usurpation, and his thus taking possession of the
throne, was the following:&mdash;It was set forth, by way of
prayer, in an address in a certain roll of parchment, that the
sons of King Edward were bastards, on the ground that he
had contracted a marriage with one Lady Eleanor Boteler,
before his marriage to queen Elizabeth; added to which, the
blood of his other brother, George, duke of Clarence, had
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_105" title="105">105</a>been attainted; so that, at the present time, no certain and
uncorrupted lineal blood could be found of Richard duke of
York, except in the person of the said Richard, duke of
Gloucester. For which reason, he was entreated, at the end
of the said roll, on part of the lords and commons of the
realm, to assume his lawful rights. However, it was at the
time rumoured that this address had been got up in the north,
whence such vast numbers were flocking to London; although,
at the same time, there was not a person but what very well
knew who was the sole mover at London of such seditious
and disgraceful proceedings.</p>

<p>These multitudes of people, accordingly, making a descent
from the north to the south, under the especial conduct and
guidance of Sir Richard Ratcliffe; on their arrival at the town
of Pomfret, by command of the said Richard Ratcliffe, and
without any form of trial being observed, Antony, earl of
Rivers, Richard Grey, his nephew, and Thomas Vaughan, an
aged knight, were, in presence of these people, beheaded.
This was the second innocent blood which was shed on the
occasion of this sudden change.</p>

<p>After these events, the said Richard, duke of Gloucester,
having summoned Thomas, the cardinal archbishop of Canterbury,
for the purpose, was on the sixth day of the month of
July following anointed and crowned King, at the conventual
church of Saint Peter at Westminster, and, on the same day
and place, his queen, Anne, received the Crown. From this
day forward, as long as he lived, this man was styled King
Richard, the third of that name from the Conquest.</p>

however, almost the value of a contemporary authority, as much of the information
was derived from Cardinal Morton.]</p>


<p>But in the mean time for this present matter I shall
rehearse you the dolorous end of those babes, not after every
way that I have heard, but after that way that I have so heard
by such men and by such means, as methinks it were hard but
it should be true. King Richard, after his coronation, taking
his way to Gloucester to visit in his new honour the town of
which he bore the name of his old, devised as he rode to fulfill
that thing which he before had intended. And forasmuch as
his mind gave him that, his nephews living, men would not
reckon that he could have right to the realm, he thought
therefore without delay to rid them, as though the killing of
his kinsmen could amend his cause, and make him a kindly
king. Whereupon he sent one John Green, whom he specially
trusted, unto sir Robert Brackenbury, Constable of the
Tower, with a letter and credence also, that the same sir
Robert should in any wise put the two children to death.
This John Green did his errand unto Brackenbury kneeling
before our Lady in the Tower, who plainly answered that he
would never put them to death, with which answer John
Green returning recounted the same to King Richard at
Warwick, yet in his way. Wherewith he took such displeasure
and thought, that the same night he said unto a
secret page of his: "Ah! whom shall a man trust? Those
that I have brought up myself, those that I had thought
would most surely serve me, even those fail me, and at my
commandment will do nothing for me." "Sir," quoth the
page, "there lieth one on your pallet without that I dare well
say, to do your grace pleasure, the thing were right hard that
he would refuse,"&mdash;meaning by this sir James Tyrrell, which
was a man of right goodly personage, and for nature's gifts
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_107" title="107">107</a>worthy to have served a much better prince, if he had well
served God, and by grace obtained as much truth and goodwill
as he had strength and wit. The man had a high heart,
and sore longed upward, not rising yet so fast as he had
hoped, being hindered and kept under by the means of sir
Richard Ratcliff and sir William Catesby, which longing for
no more partners of the prince's favour, and namely not for
him whose pride they wist would bear no peer, kept him by
secret drifts out of all secret trust. Which thing this page
well had marked and known. Wherefore this occasion offered,
of very special friendship he took his time to put him forward,
and by such wise do him good that all the enemies he had,
except the devil, could never have done him so much hurt.
For upon this page's words King Richard rose ... and came
out into the pallet chamber, on which he found in bed sir
James and sir Thomas Tyrrell, of persons alike and brethren
of blood, but nothing of kin in conditions. Then said the
King merely unto them: "What, sirs! be ye in bed so soon?"
And calling up sir James broke to him secretly his mind
in this mischievous matter. In which he found him nothing
strange. Wherefore on the morrow he sent him to Brackenbury
with a letter, by which he was commanded to deliver
sir James all the keys of the Tower for one night, to the end
he might there accomplish the King's pleasure in such thing
as he had given him commandment. After which letter
delivered and the keys received, sir James appointed the night
next ensuing to destroy them, devising before and preparing
the means. The prince, as soon as the protector left that
name and took himself as king, had it showed unto him that
he should not reign, but his uncle should have the Crown.
At which word the prince, sore abashed, began to sigh and
said: "Alas! I would my uncle would let me have my life
yet, though I lose my kingdom." Then he that told him the
tale used him with good words, and put him in the best comfort
he could. But forthwith was the prince and his brother
both shut up, and all other removed from them, only one
called Black Will or William Slaughter excepted, set to serve
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_108" title="108">108</a>them and see them sure. After which time the prince never
tied his points<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> nor ought heeded of himself, but with that
young babe his brother, lingered in thought and heaviness
until this traitorous death delivered them of that wretchedness.
For sir James Tyrrell devised that they should be
murdered in their beds. To the execution whereof he
appointed Miles Forest, one of the four that kept them, a
fellow fleshed in murder beforetime. To him he joined one
John Dighton, his own horse keeper, a big, broad, square,
strong knave. Then all the others being removed from them,
this Miles Forest and John Dighton, about midnight (the
innocent children lying in their beds) came into the chamber
and suddenly lapped them up among the clothes, so bewrapped
them and entangled them, keeping down by force the feather
bed and pillows hard unto their mouths, that within a while,
smothered and stifled, their breath failing, they gave up to
God their innocent souls into the joys of heaven, leaving to
the tormentors their bodies dead in the bed. Which, after the
wretches perceived, first by the struggling with the pains of
death, and after long lying still to be thoroughly dead, they
laid their bodies naked out upon the bed, and fetched sir
James to see them. Which upon the sight of them, caused
those murderers to bury them at the stair foot, fairly deep in
the ground under a heap of stones.</p>

<p>... He was but of a small stature having but a deformed
body; the one shoulder was higher than the other; he had
a short face and a cruel look which did betoken malice, guile
and deceit. And while he did muse upon anything standing,
he would bite his under lip continually, whereby a man might

<p>Forasmuch as the King our Sovereign Lord hath certain
knowledge that Piers, Bishop of Exeter, Jasper Tudor son of
Owen Tudor calling himself Earl of Pembroke, John late Earl
of Oxford and Sir Edward Woodeville, with other divers his
rebels and traitors, disabled and attainted by authority of the
High Court of Parliament, of whom many be known for open
murderers, adulterers and extortioners, contrary to the pleasure
of God and against all truth, honour and nature, have forsaken
their natural country, taking them first to be under the
obedience of the Duke of Brittany, and to him promised certain
things which by him and his Council were thought things too
greatly unnatural and abominable for them to grant, observe
keep and perform, and therefore the same utterly refused. The
said traitors seeing that the said Duke and his council would
not aid and succour them, nor follow their ways, privily
departed out of his country into France, there taking themselves
to be under the obedience of the King's ancient enemy
Charles, calling himself King of France; and to abuse and
blind the commons of this Realm, the said rebels and traitors
have chosen to be their captain one Henry Tudor, son of
Edmund Tudor, son of Owen Tudor, which of his ambitions
and insatiable covetousness encroacheth and usurpeth upon
him the name and title of royal estate of this Realm of England,
whereunto he hath no manner [of] interest, right, title or
colour, as every man well knoweth;... and if he should
achieve this false intent and purpose, every man's life, livelihood
and goods should be in his hands, liberty and disposi<a class="pagenum" name="Page_112" title="112">112</a>tion;
whereby should ensue the disheriting and destruction of
all the noble and worshipful blood of this realm for ever.
And to the resistance and withstanding whereof, every true
and natural Englishman born must lay to his hands for his
own surety, and well. And to the intent that the said Henry
Tudor might the rather achieve his said false intent and purpose
by the aid ... of the King's said ancient enemy of
France, [he] hath covenanted and bargained with him, and
with all the Council of France, to give and release in perpetuity
all the right, title and claim that the Kings of England have
had and might have to the crown and realm of France,
together with the duchies of Normandy, Anjou and Maine,
Gascony and Guienne, the castles and towns of Calais, Guisnes,
Hammes, with the marches appertaining to the same, and to
dissever and exclude the arms of France out of the arms of
England for ever.... And over this ... the said Henry
Tudor and other the King's rebels and traitors aforesaid, have
intended at their coming, if they can be of power, to do the
most cruel murders, slaughters, robberies and disherisons that
were ever seen in any Christian realm. For the which and
other inestimable dangers to be eschewed ... the King our
Sovereign Lord desireth, willeth and commandeth all and
every of the natural and true subjects of this his realm, to call
the premises into their minds, and like good and true Englishmen
to endeavour themselves with all their powers for the
defence of themselves, their wives, children, goods and hereditaments....
And our said Sovereign Lord, as a well-willed,
diligent and courageous Prince, will put his royal person to all
labour and pain necessary in this behalf ... and our Sovereign
Lord willeth and commandeth all his said subjects to be ready
in their most defensible array, to do his Highness service of
war, when they by open proclamation or otherwise shall be
commanded so to do for the resistance of the King's said
rebels, traitors and enemies.</p>

<p class="subheading"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;<i>A Short View of the Long Life of that ever wise, valiant and
fortunate Commander, Rice ap Thomas, Knight.</i> (Cambrian
Register, 1795.)</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The original manuscript, from which this account is taken, was
written about the year 1605, and therefore cannot claim to have the value of
a contemporary authority. But the continuator of the Croyland Chronicle,
the only contemporary account, is extremely meagre in its details of Henry's
journey through Wales; and this biography was based on contemporary
materials, the traditions of the Welsh bards and similar matter. Moreover,
in representing Rees as a confederate with Richmond before the landing, it
agrees with the contemporary English ballad of the Lady Bessy.]</p>


<p>The Earl [of Richmond] having received Rice ap Thomas's
answer, with other joyful and comfortable advertisements from
Morgan of Kidwelly, he was so greatly encouraged therewith
that no hopes of auxiliary forces from the French King or any
other necessary provisions whatsoever, could make him any
longer to disappoint his friends and confederates with an
expectation of his coming, and therefore with all convenient
speed furnishing himself with such men, money and munition
as he could readily procure, he enshipped himself and weighed
anchor from Harfleur, having but two thousand men in all,
and they, God wot, poorly provided, and so in seven days, with
a prosperous gale, he landed at Milford.</p>

<p>In the interim, Rice ap Thomas stood all upon thorns, as
conceiving there might be some private compact and underhand
working between the usurper and the French King,
whereby the just pretences of Richmond should be for ever
confounded.... Hereupon Rice musters up all his forces,
calls all his friends about him, and where he found any want
among them either of arms or other necessaries for the war, he
supplied with his own store, whereof he had sufficient as well
for ornament as for use; so that in few days he had gathered
together to the number of two thousand horse and upward, of
his own followers and retainers, bearing his name and livery.
His kinsmen and friends who came besides with brave companies
to do him honour were Sir Thomas Perrott, Sir John
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_114" title="114">114</a>Wogan, and John Savage.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> ... Arnold Butler, Richard Griffith,
John Morgan and two of his own brothers, David the
younger and John, all of them worthy soldiers and very expert
commanders, with divers others.... There came likewise out
of North Wales to this service many worthy gentlemen both of
name and note, especially of the Salisburies, under the conduct
of Robert Salisbury, a fast friend of Rice ap Thomas in the
French wars.... He [Rice] then set forth in most martial
manner towards the Dale, as his prophet whilom had advised
him, a place not far from his castle of Carew, from whence at
that time he led his army, and there meeting with the Earl of
Richmond ready to take land, he received him ashore, to whom
he made humble tender of his service, both in his own and in
all their names who were there present, and laying him down
on the ground, suffered the Earl to pass over him, so to make
good his promise to King Richard that none should enter in at
Milford unless he came first over his belly.... Rice ap
Thomas having made an end of what he would say, the Frenchmen,
lying aboard all this while, were sent for to land; who
upon their coming were marvellously well received by the
Welshmen, and entreated with all courtesy, (for that sole virtue
of courtesy towards strangers I think the Welsh go beyond all
nations of the world); every man, I say, striving to give them
all contentment, and cheering them up with fresh victuals....
The Earl of Richmond then entreated the Earls of Oxford and
Pembroke to muster the French, and to take a view of their
defects, who, upon inquiry, found they wanted both necessary
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_115" title="115">115</a>furniture of arms and other munition, besides that they were very
raw and ignorant in shooting, and handling of their weapons;
men, as it seemed, raised out of the refuse of the people and
clapped upon the Earl to avoid his further importunities.
Rice ap Thomas ... in his heart wished them back again in
France, there being not one man of quality among them....
This being done they (Richmond and Rice) with the Earls of
Oxford and Pembroke drew aside to consider of their present
state and condition, and what course was best to be taken for
their putting forward. In fine they concluded the Earl should
shape his course by Cardigan, and Rice ap Thomas by Carmarthen,
that so going several ways, the Welsh and the French
might be kept asunder, to prevent such jars and quarrels as
commonly arise between strangers; appointing Shrewsbury
for their place of meeting.</p>

realm of England into its ancient estate, honour and property,
and prosperity, as this our said principality of Wales, and the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_116" title="116">116</a>people of the same to their erst liberties, delivering them of
such miserable servitude as they have piteously long stood in:
We desire and pray you, and upon your allegiance strictly
charge and command you, that immediately upon sight hereof,
with all such power as ye may make, defensibly arrayed for
the war, ye address you towards us, without any tarrying upon
the way, until such time as ye be with us, wheresoever we
shall be, to our aid, for the effect above rehearsed, wherein ye
shall cause us in time to come to be your singular good lord;
and that ye fail not hereof as ye will avoid our grievous displeasure,
and answer it unto your peril. Given under our

<p class="subheading"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;<i>Life of Rice ap Thomas.</i> (Cambrian Register, 1795).</p>


<p>The Earl having taken Livery and Seisin of part of his
kingdom, and now in the way of possessing himself with the
whole, Rice ap Thomas forthwith commanded the beacons to
be set on fire, thereby to give notice to all the countries adjacent
of his landing, and withal to summon his friends and kinsmen
from all parts where his power was extended, to come in
with their forces, some in one place and some in another, in
his way to Shrewsbury.... Being in this glorious equipage
and so strongly provided on all hands, Rice ap Thomas made
with all speed for Shrewsbury, and, as he went, met with the
Earl of Richmond in his way, to whom he made humble obeisaunce,
vowing to follow him through all dangers, to the utter
subversion both of the tyrant and his wicked accomplices....
When the Earl was, as I said, in his way to Shrewsbury, met
and saluted by Rice ap Thomas with so goodly a band of
Welshmen, it was no small joy to him.... For you must know
the Earl all this while was much appalled and troubled in his
mind, not knowing well what to think of Rice ap Thomas,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_117" title="117">117</a>there being divers rumours dispersed up and down through his
army that the said Rice meant to side with Richard, and for
that purpose was ready to give him battle; which rumour
indeed, Rice himself, out of policy, had caused to be blown
abroad, to hoodwink the tyrant until he were in his full
strength.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> And this his device he acquainted the Earl withal,
at their first meeting, and so together they marched on to
Shrewsbury, where the Earl was received with an <i>Ave</i> cheer
and "<i>God speed thee well</i>," the street being strewed with herbs
and flowers, and the doors adorned with green boughs in testimony
of a true hearty reception.... From Shrewsbury they
went to a small village called Newport, and there Sir George
Talbot came unto the Earl with two thousand tall men....
After this for Stafford they go; thence to Lichfield and so to
Atherstone, where he and his father-in-law, the Lord Stanley,
met and consulted touching the ordering of their affairs, and
how to give battle to King Richard, which done they departed
each to his charge.</p>

<p class="subheading"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Ingulph's <i>Chronicles</i>, pp. 503-504. (Bohn Edition.)</p>


<p>At daybreak on the Monday following there were no
chaplains present to perform Divine service on behalf of King
Richard, nor any breakfast prepared to refresh the flagging
spirits of the King; besides which, as it is generally stated, in
the morning he declared that during the night he had seen
dreadful visions, and had imagined himself surrounded by a
multitude of demons. He consequently presented a countenance,
which, always attenuated, was on this occasion more
livid and ghastly than usual, and asserted that the issue of
this day's battle, to whichever side the victory might be
granted, would prove the utter destruction of the kingdom of
England. He also declared that it was his intention, if he
should prove the conqueror, to crush all the supporters of the
opposite faction; while, at the same time, he predicted that
his adversary would do the same towards the well-wishers to
his own party, in case the victory should fall to his lot.</p>

<p>At length, the prince and knights on the opposite side now
advancing at a moderate pace against the royal army, the
King gave orders that the Lord Strange<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> should be instantly
beheaded. The persons, however, to whom this duty was
entrusted, seeing that the issue was doubtful in the extreme,
and that matters of more importance than the destruction of
one individual were about to be decided, delayed the performance
of this cruel order of the King, and, leaving the man to
his own disposal, returned to the thickest of the fight.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_57" id="Footnote_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_57"><span class="label">[57]</span></a> Stanley's eldest son, who was a hostage with Richard.</p></div>

<p>A battle of the greatest severity now ensuing between the
two sides, the earl of Richmond, together with his knights,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_119" title="119">119</a>made straight for King Richard, while the earl of Oxford,
who was next in rank to him in the whole army and a most
valiant soldier, drew up his forces, consisting of a large body
of French and English troops, opposite the wing in which the
duke of Norfolk had taken up his position. In the part where
the earl of Northumberland was posted, with a large and well-provided
body of troops, there was no opposition made, as not
a blow was given or received during the battle. At length a
glorious victory was granted by heaven to the said earl of
Richmond, now sole King, together with the crown, of exceeding
value, which King Richard had previously worn on his
head. For while fighting and not in the act of flight, the said
King Richard was pierced with numerous deadly wounds, and
fell in the field like a brave and most valiant prince; upon
which, the duke of Norfolk before mentioned, Sir Richard
Ratclyffe, Sir Robert Brackenbury, keeper of the Tower of
London, John Kendall, secretary, Sir Robert Percy, controller
of the King's household, and Walter Devereux, lord
Ferrers, as well as many others, chiefly from the north, in
whom King Richard put the greatest confidence, took to
flight without engaging; and there was left no part of the
opposing army of sufficient importance or ability for the
glorious conqueror Henry the Seventh to engage, and so add
to his experience in battle.</p>

<p>Through this battle peace was obtained for the entire kingdom,
the body of the said King Richard being found among
the dead. Many insults were also heaped upon it, and, not
exactly in accordance with the laws of humanity, a halter
being thrown round the neck, it was carried to Leicester;
while the new King also proceeded to that place, graced with
the crown which he had so gloriously won.</p>

<p>While these events were taking place, many nobles and
others were taken prisoners; and in especial, Henry, Earl of
Northumberland, and Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey....
There was also taken prisoner William Catesby, who occupied
a distinguished place among all the advisers of the late King,
and whose head was cut off at Leicester as a last reward for
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_120" title="120">120</a>his excellent offices. Two gentlemen, also, of the western
parts of the kingdom, father and son, known by the name of
Brecher ... were hanged. As it was never heard, nor yet
stated in writing or by word of mouth, that any other persons,
after the termination of the warfare, were visited with similar
punishments, but that, on the contrary, the new prince had
shown clemency to all, he began to receive the praises of all,
as though he had been an angel sent down from heaven,
through whom God had deigned to visit His people, and to
deliver it from the evils with which it had hitherto, beyond
measure, been afflicted.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
